Then he helped uncover one of AI’s most surprising truths: that intelligence scales in a predictable, almost physical way.\n\nThat insight became foundational to the modern era of large language models—and led him to co-found Anthropic.\n\nIn this talk, he walks through how that discovery reshaped the path to human-level AI, what it means for future models like Claude, and why even the dumbest questions can lead to the biggest breakthroughs. He reflects on memory, oversight, and what’s left to solve as models grow smarter—and longer-horizon tasks come within reach.\n\nApply to Y Combinator: https://ycombinator.com/apply\n\nChapters:\n00:17 - From Physics to AI\n01:41 - Initial Skepticism and Shift to AI\n02:12 - AI Training Phases\n02:32 - Pre-Training\n03:16 - Reinforcement Learning\n04:19 - Scaling Laws in Training\n08:19 - Unlocking AI Capabilities\n11:27 - Organizational Knowledge and Memory\n12:19 - Oversight and Nuanced Tasks\n13:38 - Preparing for the Future\n15:48 - Claude 4 and Beyond\n21:18 - Human-AI Collaboration\n29:50 - Scaling Laws and Compute Efficiency\n35:26 - Audience Q&A",

Slides provided by Andrej: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a0h1mkwfmV2PlekxDN8isMrDA5evc4wW/view?usp=sharing\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - Intro\n01:25 - Software evolution: From 1.0 to 3.0\n04:40 - Programming in English: Rise of Software 3.0\n06:10 - LLMs as utilities, fabs, and operating systems\n11:04 - The new LLM OS and historical computing analogies\n14:39 - Psychology of LLMs: People spirits and cognitive quirks\n18:22 - Designing LLM apps with partial autonomy\n23:40 - The importance of human-AI collaboration loops\n26:00 - Lessons from Tesla Autopilot & autonomy sliders\n27:52 - The Iron Man analogy: Augmentation vs. agents\n29:06 - Vibe Coding: Everyone is now a programmer\n33:39 - Building for agents: Future-ready digital infrastructure\n38:14 - Summary: We’re in the 1960s of LLMs — time to build\n\nDrawing on his work at Stanford, OpenAI, and Tesla, Andrej sees a shift underway. Software is changing, again. We’ve entered the era of “Software 3.0,” where natural language becomes the new programming interface and models do the rest.\n\nHe explores what this shift means for developers, users, and the design of software itself— that we're not just using new tools, but building a new kind of computer.\n\nMore content from Andrej: https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy\n\nThoughts (From Andrej Karpathy!)\n0:49 - Imo fair to say that software is changing quite fundamentally again. LLMs are a new kind of computer, and you program them *in English*. Hence I think they are well deserving of a major version upgrade in terms of software.\n6:06 - LLMs have properties of utilities, of fabs, and of operating systems → New LLM OS, fabbed by labs, and distributed like utilities (for now). Many historical analogies apply - imo we are computing circa ~1960s.\n14:39 - LLM psychology: LLMs = \"people spirits\", stochastic simulations of people, where the simulator is an autoregressive Transformer. Since they are trained on human data, they have a kind of emergent psychology, and are simultaneously superhuman in some ways, but also fallible in many others. Given this, how do we productively work with them hand in hand?\nSwitching gears to opportunities...\n18:16 - LLMs are \"people spirits\" → can build partially autonomous products.\n29:05 - LLMs are programmed in English → make software highly accessible! (yes, vibe coding)\n33:36 - LLMs are new primary consumer/manipulator of digital information (adding to GUIs/humans and APIs/programs) → Build for agents!\n\nSome of the links:\n- Software 2.0 blog post from 2017 https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35\n- How LLMs flip the script on technology diffusion https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/power-to-the-people/\n- Vibe coding MenuGen (retrospective) https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/vibe-coding-menugen/\n\nApply to Y Combinator: https://ycombinator.com/apply\nWork at a startup: https://workatastartup.com",

Scholl started as a software engineer and pivoted mid career to aviation. Now he’s at the forefront of trying to bring back supersonic travel for all of us. In this episode of Hard Tech, YC’s Jared Friedman visited Scholl in the Mojave desert to find out how someone who didn’t have a background in aerospace engineering was able to build the first ever independently developed supersonic plane.\n\nApply to Y Combinator: https://ycombinator.com/apply\n\nSpecial Thanks To The Museum of Flight: https://www.museumofflight.org/\n\nChapters (Powered by https://bit.ly/chapterme-yc) - \n00:00 - Intro\n01:30 - Supersonic jet\n02:36 - Idea\n04:31 - Experience\n05:59 - Economics\n08:10 - Networking\n11:02 - Team\n12:40 - Advice",

      "description": "In our new documentary series Backstory we’re profiling the extraordinary Group Partners at the heart of YC. And we’re kicking it off with Surbhi Sarna, YC’s first healthcare and biotech focused Group Partner. In 2018 Surbhi Sarna sold her company nVision for $275 million to one of the world’s leading healthcare companies. But to understand how Surbhi got where she is today, you have to go back to her sophomore year in high school, when a cancer scare upended her life and set her on an entirely new path. \n\nIn this episode Surbhi opens up about her health scare, how it impacted her life going forward and how she was able to ignore the people who doubted her along the way. If you've ever felt undervalued or under appreciated, Surbhi's story will provide you with insights and advice on how to overcome those hurdles on your journey to starting a company.\n\nApply to Y Combinator: https://yc.link/Backstory-apply \nWork at a Startup: https://yc.link/Backstory-jobs\n\nChapters (Powered by https://bit.ly/chapterme-yc) - \n00:00 - Backstory\n01:00 - Problem with Ovarian Cyst \n02:39 - How nVision Medical was Born?\n03:34 - Working as an Engineer and Starting a Company\n04:24 - Validating the Idea\n05:52 - Fundraising to Build a Prototype\n06:14 - Investors Reaction to Women's Health\n06:45 - Difficulty as a Female Founder\n07:22 - Getting Funded\n08:13 - Acquisition by Boston Scientific\n09:51 - First YC Healthcare and Bio Partner\n11:10 - Outro: Being a Group Partner at YC\n\nArchival school footage provided courtesy of Ryan Briggs",

How big were you? What did you do in YC?\n00:03:29 So $15,000 thousand dollars let you manufacture, was it the first 100 units?\n00:05:38 How many units had you sold before you actually went through the entire manufacturing process? 700 to 800 units\n00:05:58 What happens if I  have to move my business to Mountain View? Its gonna interrupt my production process\n00:06:44 Hardest part in the whole journey with Pebble?\n00:08:28 But now that you've done it do you think it's possible now?\n00:10:50 It's often people get really creative with no money but forget once raised money\n00:12:14 Advise on right time to do crowdfunding campaign, is a real product required and should it align with the campaign?\n00:16:00 In the first route, delivery of product within six months is unknown. Should I use crowdfunding platform only if I know I can deliver?\n00:16:53 Sometimes there's a group (Facebook, Subreddits) before the early adopters on Kickstarter\n00:17:27 What's the right call in terms of outsourcing the various components?\n00:19:46 Belief in “hardware without software (subscription instead of one off)” and thoughts on people who say that?\n00:23:11 How do you define hard tech, deep tech?

What should they consider?\n00:32:15 Users interested in your product but need lot of money. What do you need to show to investors?\n00:33:59 What's an idea that sounded so crazy when you heard but when you met the founder you were like this is totally possible?\n00:37:17 Q1 - How do you get your first customers? How do you get 1-50?\n00:39:40 Q2 - Bunch of software engineers, we have an idea that includes software and hardware, how do we get started on the hardware?\n00:42:55 Q3 - Pre product market fit, do you recommend move closer to suppliers?\n00:44:12 Q4 - Do we have to protect (IP/Trademark) our products or how can we protect?\n00:47:02 Q5 - Building Hard-Tech and solving a long term problem but first problem looks too small? Marginal markets are great\n00:48:58 Q6 - Should I pick a recurring business model or just sell the product?\n00:50:48 Q7 - How do you do hiring, especially when you're scaling?\n00:54:23 Q8 - For some project problems, they can be solved exclusively by software, how do you know when to involve hardware in it?\n00:56:05 Q9 - How do we demo really complex product or how do we convey it to people?\n00:57:21 Q10 - Why hardware companies need financing?",

Where did the idea come from?\n00:03:47 How Science Exchange helps organize the very fragmented market for research?\n00:05:54 Was it difficult to make the switch and not work on the one thing that you focused on during research?\n00:07:56 Advice for people who want start a startup from a research at University? Sometimes it’s a huge obstacle from universities. How can they navigate?\n00:09:08 Do you think there is a overall trend in people moving from academics into startups?\n00:11:46 How did you get your first users for Science Exchange marketplace?\n00:14:08 What was more difficult – Supply or demand?\n00:15:54 Do you remember on the demand side, the very first customer? What were they? What did they do?\n00:17:04 So we talked a lot about at Startup School, product market fit. For you what  was that like? When did you know you had that? And how did you define  it? And what metrics were you looking at?\n00:19:51 Reproducibility Initiative (reproduce to validate experiments) -  why has this never been done? Was it a money problem or can only Science Exchange solve?\n00:23:09 What are the two top two complex factors?\n00:25:10 What is the biggest challenge as a CEO of  a marketplace company that you have today? And how has that challenge morphed over time?\n00:27:03 There has been this implosion of biotech startups recently, especially in Silicon Valley, what do you think that is? What are the causes for this?\n00:30:04 Are there any similarities between biotech and software?\n00:31:25 What does an MVP mean in biotech?\n00:33:13 What has changed that has allowed a small companies product to go-to-market without getting acquired?\n00:34:36 Science Exchange is helping speed up experiments, trolls, and getting through the FDA process.\n00:35:48 Common mistakes you've seen biotech founders make? What do you just need and what do you avoid at all costs?\n00:37:33 What do you think about the need for a business co-founder and should that be a goal?\n00:39:30 Non-scientists who are interested in biotech, what should they do? Get a PhD or what's the potential path?\n00:42:17 Decisions you’ve made that was a game changer (inflection point)?\n00:43:29 100 years from now, what do you think Science Exchange will be?\n00:45:16 Q1 - whether we should look at new approaches too, instead of just looking at correlations to look for causality in a space with unknowns?\n00:46:40 Q2 - Idea to an MVP in a short space of time, and the steps that required to do that?\n00:49:27 Q3 - Importance of credentials in the biotech space?\n00:51:29 Q4 - when did you decide to leave academics?\n00:53:18 Q5 - Quality control in a two sided marketplace?",

      "description": "Glenn Kelman, CEO of Redfin, talks through how he built his board of directors, and shares lessons-learned.\n\nTopics discussed:\n\n-What you’re really looking for: What to look for in an investor who’s joining your board — good board members should love your mission, listen more than they talk, and attend every meeting in-person. Glenn also discussed why it’s good to bring on a fellow operator who can relate to you as a peer (talking about Selina Tobaccowala joining the board.\n\n-Take the time to draft a job description: This should cover the background and skills needed in your next board member. Use it to guide your recruiting process. Consider asking founders at similar companies for advice, and use executives and board members from your company to source candidates.\n\n-Diversity: Incorporate diversity in the board early on.\nInterviewing: When interviewing potential board members, don’t focus on being impressive or being impressed. You cannot truly listen in either mode.\n\n-Problems are your problems: At the end of the day, the CEO is the one in charge of operating the company. If the product is not selling or working, that is the CEO’s problem — not a board problem.\n\n-How to get the most from your meetings: Board meetings should always be held in-person and include printed documents. The act of projecting a powerpoint can diminish participation, and you can lose a lot of people. Afterward, Glenn also recommends that you share most board meeting documents internally with the whole company to maintain transparency.\n\nThis conversation took place at The Scaleup Offsite, a private CEO gathering hosted by Y Combinator Continuity and Greylock Partners in April 2017.",

      "description": "Jason Kilar is the former CEO of Hulu and Vessel, and an early executive at Amazon. He joined us at The Scaleup Offsite to talk about establishing and scaling a company’s culture.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nCulture starts with what you do when nobody is looking.\n\nHow a trip Disney World as a kid made Jason obsessed with companies and cultures that, at scale, stand above others. After he landed his first job at Disney, he came to observe the following cultural best practices:\n\n- Be explicit about what you want the culture of your company to be.\n- Walk the talk. Walt Disney would stop to pick up the smallest piece of litter at the theme park, which reinforced the message that attention to detail was super important.\n- Embrace mechanisms Invent or use good processes that can be repeated and delivered at scale.\nIn Jason’s time at Amazon, the company had a “just do it” award, which served as mechanism for reinforcing great behaviors from employees. Everything from saving on electrical bills to pushing back on bureaucracy.\n\nWhen you think about your culture, think of it as a repellent as much as a magnet. You want some people to feel like it’s not for you.\n\nA challenge with great cultures is that you have to live up to them every day. You will be tested often, and you need to fight for things that are important to your value and principles.\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nAmazon’s Leadership Principles - https://www.amazon.jobs/principles\n\nThis talk took place at The Scaleup Offsite, a private CEO gathering hosted by Y Combinator Continuity and Greylock Partners in April 2017.",
