      "description": "On this episode of The Ben & Marc Show, a16z co-founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz sit down with Adam Neumann—founder of WeWork and now, Flow—to unpack one of the most unlikely comeback stories in tech.\n\nWhat began as a personal reckoning after a very public fall has become a bold new vision for how we live and belong. Flow isn’t just a real estate company—it’s an operating system for community, built on first-principles software, design, and soul.\n\nJoined by a16z General Partner Erik Torenberg, the group goes deep on:\n\n- Why Adam’s childhood shaped his obsession with community\n- Adam’s fall from WeWork—and how he found a new path to redemption\n- How Flow is re-architecting real estate from scratch\n- Why loneliness is the greatest design challenge of our time\n\nWith reflections on dyslexia, the American dream, and the thin line between failure and greatness, this is a candid and wide-ranging conversation about redemption, vision, and building something that matters in this world. We hope you enjoy this deeply human conversation about the future of living.\n\nTimecodes\n00:00 Introduction \n00:51 Adam's Early Life and Family Background\n07:56 Military Service and Discipline\n10:08 Transition to the US and Education\n14:43 Entrepreneurial Journey Begins\n17:49 The Concept of Flow and Vision\n20:28 Meeting and Partnership Formation\n25:22 Overcoming Challenges and Resilience\n28:30 The Isolation Phenomenon\n30:03 Navigating Post-Crisis Relationships\n31:50 Real Estate Strategies During COVID\n33:47 The Genesis of a New Venture\n36:47 Lessons from WeWork\n38:49 Building Flow: The Vision\n41:44 The Importance of Alignment\n51:23 Technological Innovations in Real Estate\n55:44 Revolutionizing Real Estate Software and Flexible Living Solutions\n56:28 Challenges and Innovations in Multifamily Housing Rental Markets\n58:40 Global Housing Crisis and Solutions\n01:06:10 Expanding to Saudi Arabia\n01:08:49 Success in Saudi Arabia\n01:12:43 Real Estate Funds and Future Plans\n01:19:10: Why Is This an Opportunity? \n01:20:45 Impact of COVID on Living and Working\n01:26:14 Future Potential of Housing and Living\n\nResources: \n\nRead Marc's blog post about Flow: https://a16z.com/announcement/flow/\n\nMarc on X: https://x.com/pmarca \nMarc’s Substack: https://pmarca.substack.com/ \n\nBen on X: https://x.com/bhorowitz \n\nErik on X: https://x.com/eriktorenberg \nErik's Substack: https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/\n\nStay Updated: \n\nFind us on X: https://x.com/a16z \nFind us on LinkedIn:   https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\n\nThis information is for general educational purposes only and is not a recommendation to buy, hold, or sell any investment or financial product.

Together, they explore the concept of world models—AI systems that understand and reason about the physical, 3D world—not just text.\n\nFei-Fei, often called the “godmother of AI,” explains why spatial intelligence is a critical (and missing) component of today's AI systems, and why her new company is going all-in on solving this challenge. Martin shares the story of how he and Fei-Fei aligned on this vision long before it was trendy - and why it may define the future of robotics, creativity, and computation itself.\n\nFrom the limitations of LLMs to the promise of embodied AI, from personal anecdotes to deep technical insights, this is a discussion on what it truly means to build intelligence for the real (and virtual) world.\n\nTimecodes: \n00:00 Spatial Intelligence\n00:39 Fei-Fei Li’s Background\n01:17 Building a World Model\n05:14 Reflecting on AI's Evolution\n08:07 The Importance of 3D Understanding\n10:20  Unrolling Evolution: Why 3D Intelligence Is Harder Than Language\n12:19 From Single Reality to Infinite Virtual Universes\n16:52 3D vs 2D: Why 2D Isn’t Enough for Machines\n17:57 Fei-Fei’s Personal Story of Losing Stereo Vision\n19:24 Research and Development at World Labs\n\nResources: \nFind Fei-Fei on X: https://x.com/drfeifei\nFind Martin on X: https://x.com/martin_casado\nLearn more about World Labs: https://www.worldlabs.ai/\n\nStay Updated: \nLet us know what you think: https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z \nFind a16z on Twitter: https://twitter.com/a16z \nFind a16z on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z \nSubscribe on your favorite podcast app: https://a16z.simplecast.com/ \nFollow our host: https://x.com/eriktorenberg\n\nPlease note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

      "description": "In this episode of the a16z AI podcast, a16z Infra partners Guido Appenzeller, Matt Bornstein, and Yoko Li explore how generative AI is reshaping software development. From its potential as a new high-level programming abstraction to its current practical impacts, they discuss whether AI coding tools will redefine what it means to be a developer.\n\nWhy has coding emerged as one of AI's most powerful use cases? How much can AI truly boost developer productivity, and will it fundamentally change traditional computer science education? Guido, Yoko, and Matt dive deep into these questions, addressing the dynamics of \"vibe coding,\" the enduring role of formal programming languages, and the critical challenge of managing non-deterministic behavior in AI-driven applications.\n\nAmong other things, they discuss:\n- The enormous market potential of AI-generated code, projected to deliver trillions in productivity gains.\n- How \"prompt-based programming\" is evolving from Stack Overflow replacements into sophisticated development assistants.\n- Why formal languages like Python and Java are here to stay, even as natural language interactions become common.\n- The shifting landscape of programming education, and why understanding foundational abstractions remains essential.\n- The unique complexities of integrating AI into enterprise software, from managing uncertainty to ensuring reliability.\n\n00:00:39 - Who’s Coding Now? / Why is coding such a big use case?\n00:05:41 - How has AI already changed software development?\n00:13:05 - Vibe Coding vs. ‘Serious’ Engineering\n00:17:30 - Vibe Coding and the future of Computer Science Education\n00:23:15 - How does Vibe Coding affect programming languages?\n00:35:07 - Adjusting to non-deterministic outputs\n00:38:43 - Are prompts the narrow waist of AI programming?\n00:42:22 - The nexus of Vibe Coding and enterprise programming",

Just as mobile, cloud, and social shaped the internet of the past 20 years, so too could crypto, AI, and new hardware usher in an era of the internet that’s pro-innovation, pro-startup, and pro-creator. \n\nSpeaking with a16z Growth General Partner David George, a16z crypto Founder and Managing Partner Chris Dixon breaks down his vision for a new internet, from using crypto to decentralize AI infrastructure and kickstart network effects, to why AI will be this era’s native form of media just as film was in the 1930s. He also explores why the internet’s original covenant—where content creators traded free access for search traffic—is breaking today, and how a better internet could introduce entirely new business models for creators. \n\nRight now, we have a choice to make: will the next era of the internet be shaped by a handful of centralized players, or transformed into an open ecosystem where power and control flow to creators across the globe?\n\nRead a full transcript here: https://a16z.com/ai-crypto-internet-chris-dixon/\n\n[00:00:30] How technology evolves\n[00:02:54] How crypto and AI interact\n[00:08:39] Breaking the economic pact of the internet\n[00:12:57] From mobile, social, and cloud to crypto, AI, and hardware\n[00:14:49] Using crypto to bootstrap network effects\n[00:16:33] Is AI frosting or sugar?\n[00:19:57] Come for the tool, stay for the network\n[00:20:39] Skeuomorphic vs. native technologies\n[00:26:07] AI as the creative substrate of our era\n[00:30:11] Balancing supply and demand in AI\n[00:35:03] What decides consumer adoption of AI?\n[00:36:05] What is the ideal future state of the internet?\n\nIn our conversation series AI Revolution, we ask industry leaders how they’re harnessing the power of generative AI and steering their companies through the next platform shift.

      "description": "Two words have caught the Internet by storm. DeepSeek. \n\nThe Chinese reasoning model r1 is rivaling others at the frontier with an open-source MIT license, methods that some claim may be 45x more efficient, an alleged $5.6m cost, the release of reasoning traces, a follow-on image model, and the fact that all of this was released by a hedge fund China.\n\nMany are already referring to this as a Sputnik moment. If that’s true, how should we – whether founder, researcher, policy maker – not just react, but act? Joining us to tease out the signal from the noise are a16z General Partner Martin Casado and a16z board partner, Steven Sinofsky. Both Martin and Steven have been on the frontlines of prior computing cycles, from the switching wars to the fiber buildout, and have witnessed the trajectories of companies like Cisco to AOL to ATT – even Worldcom.\n\nSo what really drove this DeepSeek frenzy and more importantly what should we take away?

      "description": "In this episode, Chris Ellis and Adam Stevenson, co-founders of Thatch, join a16z partners, Julie Yoo and Jay Rughani, for a deep dive into the evolving landscape of healthcare benefits—primarily through the lens of ICHRA (Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement). Starting with the history of employer-sponsored insurance, the trio explores how changes in the labor market and rising healthcare costs are accelerating the need for new, employee-centric models. Thatch's innovative approach empowers employers to offer flexible, tax-free allowances for healthcare spending, putting personalized choice in the hands of employees. For biotech and healthcare entrepreneurs, this episode offers fresh insights into the business opportunities created by decentralized healthcare and the technological challenges behind scaling such a model.\n\n\n[00:00:05] The Shift to Consumers as Payers:\nOver the decades, individual consumers have taken on more of the healthcare burden. Tools like ICHRA provide flexibility, giving employees more autonomy over their health coverage.\n\n[00:01:10] The Origin of Employer-Sponsored Insurance & Why It's Outdated:\nEmployer-based health benefits grew from historical events like World War II wage freezes and tax laws. With today’s changing labor market, there’s demand for solutions like ICHRA.\n\n[00:06:45] ICHRA: A Flexible Framework for the Future:\nEstablished four years ago, ICHRA allows companies to allocate tax-free money for employees to customize insurance. Early adopters include startups, trucking companies, and dental clinics.\n\n[00:08:05] From Pensions to 401(k)s and Now Health Insurance:\nLike the shift from pensions to 401(k)s, ICHRA represents a move to employee-controlled funds, offering a scalable, personalized healthcare framework.\n\n[00:11:00] The Role of Technology in Simplifying ICHRA:\nThatch aims to simplify ICHRA management for employees and employers by providing tech-driven solutions to allocate funds and select plans, similar to Stripe’s approach for payments.\n\n[00:22:00] The Future of Niche Insurance & Consumer Choice:\nICHRA could inspire niche health insurance companies tailored to specific needs, fostering a more competitive insurance market with specialized plans.\n\n\n\nResources: \nFind Julie on X: https://x.com/julesyoo \nFind Jay on X: https://x.com/JayRughani \nLearn more about a16z Bio+Health: https://a16z.com/bio-health/\n\n\n\nPlease note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

      "description": "In this episode, a16z co-founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz explore the intersection of AI and crypto, highlighting the rise of Truth Terminal (@truth_terminal), an autonomous chatbot developed by AI researcher Andy Ayrey. With its own X account, Truth Terminal generates original and often hilarious content independently.\n\nMarc's interaction with the bot recently took a surprising turn when he decided to grant it $50,000 in Bitcoin. This funding sparked Truth Terminal’s ambition to launch its own token, eventually leading to the creation of the meme coin “GOAT” by an anonymous developer.  “GOAT” recently skyrocketed to a $300m valuation. \n\nJoin Ben and Marc in this latest episode of \"The Ben & Marc Show\" as they discuss how this still unfolding story reflects the potential for community-driven systems and its implications for the future of digital assets.

      "description": "\"We decided to design for the future.\" – Marc Andreessen | Welcome back to \"The Ben & Marc Show,\" featuring a16z co-founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. In this special episode, Marc and Ben dive deep into the REAL story behind the creation of Netscape—a web browser co-created by Marc that revolutionized the internet and changed the world. \n\nAs Ben notes at the top, until today, this story has never been fully told either in its entirety or accurately.\n\nIn this one-on-one conversation, Marc and Ben discuss Marc's early life and how it shaped his journey into technology, the pivotal moments at the University of Illinois that led to the development of Mosaic (a renegade browser that Marc developed as an undergrad), and the fierce competition and legal battles that ensued as Netscape rose to prominence.\n\nBen and Marc also reflect on the broader implications of Netscape's success, the importance of an open internet, and the lessons learned that still resonate in today's tech landscape (especially with AI). That and much more.

Right?\n\nWell, as much as we’d all like to believe that we embrace the new… the reality is that we often resist change.\n\nThat’s why we’ve brought in someone who has studied how humans respond to and adapt to change – or sometimes how we fail to. That person is Jason Feifer – long-time editor in chief at Entrepreneur Magazine, host of two popular podcasts, and recent author of his book Build for Tomorrow. \n\nToday, Jason shares 6 specific frameworks around the very natural human responses to change, which he’s developed through interviewing and studying some of the most influential people in the world – past and present. We also play a fun game at the end, where Jason comments on current technologies encountering pushback, and assesses where they might fit into his framework.\n\nTopics Covered:\n00:00 - Introduction\n04:06 - Why adaptability matters\n08:10 - Framework 1: We do not believe in our own adaptability\n22:24 - Framework 2: We don’t know what new things are for\n28:26 - Framework 3: Innovators don’t build a bridge\n37:36 - Framework 4: We mistake a 1% problem for a 100% problem\n44:38 - Framework 5: We imbue innovations with personal anxieties\n51:22 - Framework 6: We oversimplify problems\n1:03:45 - Framework summary\n1:04:55 - Game: Jason assesses current technologies!\n\nResources: \n* Jason’s website: https://www.jasonfeifer.com/ \n* Jason on Twitter: https://twitter.com/heyfeifer \n* Jason’s book Build for Tomorrow: https://www.jasonfeifer.com/book/ \n\nStay Updated: \n* Find us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/a16z \n* Find us on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z \n* Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: https://a16z.simplecast.com/ \n* Follow our host: https://twitter.com/stephsmithio \n\nPlease note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund.

      "description": "Very rarely—perhaps even just once a generation—an extraordinary event or force comes along that completely transforms a stagnant industry. We are experiencing that moment right now in healthcare, as the very topology of the entire landscape changes and we see a mass acceleration of opportunities for company creation across the care delivery space. In this talk, a16z General Partner Julie Yoo talks about what those opportunities are; how the value chain is being rewired; the impact of new regulation; and how fundamental dislocation on both the supply and demand sides of the market upend the very manner by which processes and stakeholders are linked together.",

      "description": "Gaming has dominated the entertainment industry, eclipsing the revenues for both film and music. As the current CEO of Unity Technologies and the former CEO of Electronic Arts, John Riccitiello is at the forefront of this $139B industry. In this conversation with a16z general partner Andrew Chen, he discusses the forces that are propelling gaming’s unprecedented growth—from platform convergence to live streaming—as well as Unity's expansion into the film, automotive, and architecture industries.\n\nHighlights\nGaming World-wide has reached over three billion users. [2:13]\nHow Unity has revolutionized the game creation experience, from cross-platform formatting to accelerating game production [4:55]\nHow Unity shifted its focus from mobile gaming to cross-platform. [11:31]\nThe game industry’s evolution from physical media to digital and interactive gameplay. [15:15]\nHow the game industry has leveraged technology, social interaction, and novelty to grow exponentially. [17:03]\nThe rise of digital gaming—from console to game studios [24:45]\nThe enormous opportunities available via direct-to-consumer gaming. [32:55]\nThe challenges behind creating the “Netflix” of gaming [36:01]\nNew technologies and the rise of cloud gaming. [37:38]\nGaming’s impact on other industries [40:34]\n\nPull Quotes\n“I think the economics will end up being a little bit different because it’s not an unfettered competitive marketplace. It’s one that’s controlled by an individual capitalist that thinks eSports is a marketing program.”\n\n“For a lot of your children, if not some of you here: their digital handle around gaming provides them a level of social status that is actually both exciting and a little bit scary. They’re important in that world.”",

      "description": "Download the slide presentation from Angel's talk here: http://bit.ly/39NSOzd\n\nThe first wave of fintech companies a decade ago proved that we don’t need physical locations for banking. Now, the next wave is unlocking the remaining infrastructure for building better financial services: banking licenses, payment processors, regulatory compliance, and so on. Because startups (and incumbents) can now draw on these APIs and more, they can create better products that help many, many more people. It also means that any company could become a financial services company… imagine banking with your favorite brand!\n\nHighlights\nThe fintech trends transforming the infrastructure of banking [0:59]\nWhere we are in banking today; the current state of financial services [1:44]\nAngela outlines the problems with modern financial services [2:43]\nDrawing parallels between the process of software development and the current problems in financial services [3:47]\nDefinition of “AWS phase” of financial services [4:30]\nHow Uber and Lyft are integrating banking services into their business model [6:17]\nWhy the “as a service” trend is reaching the banking industry now [7:24]\nAngela analyzes the banking stack and shares what it takes to start a bank [7:41]\nHow to build a financial planning app [9:05]\nCurrent on trend apps: Plaid as a case study [10:06]\nCurrent on trend apps: Synapse as a case study [11:03]\nAngela examines regulation in banking and our current approach to anti-money laundering [12:44]\nCurrent on trend apps: Comply Advantage as a case study [14:29]\nCurrent on trend apps: Sentilink as a case study [16:30]\n\nPull Quotes\n“Now, what's so unique about this disruption is that oftentimes there's one winner and there's a ton of losers. But in this case, everyone has the opportunity to participate and improve significantly. For startups, we've seen some of the examples of the new infrastructure companies that are being built, and there's many more opportunities there. But there's even more opportunities in the thousands of experiments that are gonna be unleashed on top.”\n\n“Now, we would expect this innovation to come from startups, to come from existing financial services institutions. But a great majority of it, I think, will come from companies that are adding financial services for the very first time.”",

Their conversation ranges from the early days of the web to the way innovation happens (what Chris calls “outside-in vs inside-out”) to the promise of a community-owned and operated internet, and more.\n\nTogether they explore the possibilities that could co-evolve and converge are we enter into the next era of the web, and they share how we might not be quite as far removed from the “wild west days” of the internet as we imagined.\n\nSHOW NOTES\nThe pioneering spirit of the early internet [5:10]\nPredictions about what we can expect from the internet as it continues to evolve [6:31]\nOutside-in vs. Inside-out technology adoption patterns [8:11]\nWhy big innovations often happen outside of regular business hours [9:38]\nWhy the Internet is a constantly evolving organism [11:33]\nDefinition and examples of first order and second order effects of the Internet [12:37]\nDefinition of Fourth and Fifth Estate [14:14]\nDiscussion on Decentralized networks [15:37]\nThe possible future of Internet governance [18:30]\nBlockchain as an extension of open source [20:11]\nA brief history of RSS and the innovations it lead to [22:05]\nChris breaks down the next phase of technological convergence [27:50]\nThe expansion of transactional media [37:30]\n\n***\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

In this talk from a16z Summit, D’Arcy Coolican shares how to create products that follow macro trends and and gives examples of current trends capturing the attention of the media, investors, and talent teams today. D’Arcy identifies the ever-elusive concept of product zeitgeist fit including how to spot it, embrace it, and capitalize on it.\n\nDownload the slide presentation from this talk here: http://bit.ly/2RBKa0U\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\nWhat is product zeitgeist fit?

The things that are sitting in the zeitgeist.”\n\n“The death of most startups isn’t because they don’t get their tech to work or their competition out-executes them. The death of most startups is indifference. They fail to launch because nobody cares.”",

      "description": "“You cannot be IN it… and not be OF it.”\n\nDapper Dan a.k.a. Daniel Day shares his remarkable history and story of defining an era of fashion and cultural influence in this special episode of the a16z Podcast -- based on his conversation (also available as video here) with Ben Horowitz around his memoir, Made in Harlem.\n\nDapper Dan pioneered high-end streetwear in the early 1980s, remixing luxury brand logos into his own designs for gangsters, athletes, and musicians, dressing cultural icons from Salt-N-Pepa and Eric B. & Rakim to Beyoncé and Jay-Z along the way. Going on to define an era, his work has been featured in exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Met, The Smithsonian, and more. But he began as a hungry, fast learner in Harlem who became a gambler; spent a brief stint in a foreign jail where he nourished himself with reading; and then studied the market to build his fashion business, trendsetting the concepts of logomania and later, influencer marketing. Today, Dapper Dan has a unique partnership with Gucci and reopened his boutique in 2017.\n\nFrom “the struggle” when not given the privileges and opportunities that others have to the struggle of building and then losing and then reinventing oneself again and again, this special episode offers inspiration for all kinds of makers -- including the power of “studying the game”; the power of listening to your customers (not in the cliché way!); and the power of cultural influence… and voice.\n\nphoto credits: Alain McLaughlin",

      "description": "One of the most popular applications on the internet is social media, for better... and for worse. So if we were to imagine how crypto and blockchains could transform social networking in the future, how might that look? It's still early days yet, so no one knows for sure, but there are several indicators today, and some interesting examples with email too.\n\nSo in this talk, general partner Chris Dixon -- and close observer as well as entrepreneur during internet 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 -- imagines social networking \"in 2030\": How does decentralization change things, from business models to governance to all kinds of stakeholders and users? And how can this work beyond social networking to other applications?\n\nThis talk was originally delivered at the inaugural a16z Crypto Regulatory Summit 2019, which brings together leading crypto experts and builders, other technologists, academics, industry executives, and government officials -- along with forward-thinking regulators -- to foster collaboration and the exchange of ideas around this important emerging industry.",

      "description": "Before Cortana, before Siri, before Alexa, even before smart interactive voice response (IVR) systems, there was Microsoft’s Office Assistant, one of the first widely deployed digital assistants that shipped as part of Microsoft Office in 1997. You might remember this feature better as the animated paper clip Clippy, even though Microsoft insists its (his? her?) official name is ClippIt. Doesn’t ring a bell? How about this: “It looks like you’re writing a letter”? \n\nEven though Microsoft officially retired Clippy in April 2011, the character continuously resurfaces as a meme in the zeitgeist. Try https://www.reddit.com/r/Clippy/ to see an assortment. Or check out Microsoft Cloud Developer Advocate Chloe Condon’s business card in her tweet (one of our inspirations for making this history): https://twitter.com/chloecondon/status/1098732324622020609?lang=en\n\nIn this episode, a16z Board Partner and longtime Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky shares his personal remembrances of Clippy with a16z Operating Partner Frank Chen. They discuss these and many more vignettes from the history of Clippy:\n- What problem the newly formed Microsoft Office team was trying to solve: https://youtu.be/8bhjNvSSuLM?t=129\n- Which Stanford University and Microsoft Research ideas informed the design of the feature: https://youtu.be/8bhjNvSSuLM?t=396\n- How the project was approved, what size team worked on it, and what BillG thought of it (warning: f-bomb ahead!): https://youtu.be/8bhjNvSSuLM?t=1121\n- What user testing the team did on both the look-and-feel of the feature, as well as the cast of characters that ended up in the gallery (dolphins! geniuses not named Einstein! leprechauns!): https://youtu.be/8bhjNvSSuLM?t=2155\n- How a pair of legendary Disney animators inspired the \"stage\" the characters perform on: https://youtu.be/8bhjNvSSuLM?t=1944\n- How the feature got launched and marketed, and early reactions from users and reviewers: https://youtu.be/8bhjNvSSuLM?t=2851\n- How Clippy got an elaborate real-world retirement party in San Francisco, complete with a blues song: https://youtu.be/8bhjNvSSuLM?t=3427\n- Watch Clippy featured  on Conan O'Brien's late night TV show: https://youtu.be/8bhjNvSSuLM?t=3927\n- What Clippy can tell us about the future of digital assistants: https://youtu.be/8bhjNvSSuLM?t=4030\n- The nature of risk-taking in software product development: https://youtu.be/8bhjNvSSuLM?t=4424\n\nEnjoy watching the full arc of Clippy's life from prototype to retirement to cultural meme.\n\n***\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

      "description": "When people talk about trends in education technology, they often focus on how to disrupt higher education in the U.S., whether it's about breaking free of the \"signaling\" factor of elite educations or how to shift education out of its \"cottage industry\" mindset to achieve greater scale. However, in China, the transformation of education is already well underway, with a fast-growing ecosystem built around lifelong learning. In fact, one of the largest demographic groups paying for education in China is actually not college students -- it's college graduates, aged 26 through 35.In this episode -- which originally aired as a video on our YouTube channel -- a16z general partner Connie Chan talks with operating partner Frank Chen about the lifelong learning ecosystem in China; what it means for startups there; and lessons for entrepreneurs everywhere... or will these techniques even work outside of China?",

      "description": "In the world of finance and financial technology, established companies are starting to look at the rearview mirror at fast-approaching startups, wondering just how true the phrase “objects in mirror are closer than they appear” might be. What is causing this acceleration in fintech startup traction? What should the incumbents be nervous about? And, more importantly, what should they do about it?\n\nAlex Rampell, a16z general partner (and former fintech entrepreneur as the CEO and co-founder of TrialPay), joins a16z operating partner Frank Chen to discuss the changing fintech landscape. They discuss both lessons learned from the perspective of the the hungry and fast fintech startup, as well as concrete advice for execs in the hot seat at established companies.",

The company is responsible for some of the most iconic entertainment franchises, including Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft -- as well as its own professional esports league.\n\nSo in this episode of the a16z Podcast, Marc Andreessen interviews Kotick on everything from the evolution of video games in the 1980s to gaming trends more broadly. What changes as gaming goes from \"just for nerds\" to \"just for kids\" and spreads more broadly into entertainment and cultural phenomena (esports, Fortnite, Pokemon Go, etc.)... both online and offline?\n\nThe conversation originally took place at our annual innovation a16z Summit in November 2018 -- which features a16z speakers and invited experts from various organizations discussing innovation at companies small and large.

      "title": "a16z Podcast | The Science and Business of Innovative Medicines",
      "description": "On average, only 1 out of 20 medicines works when we actually bring them into human beings, and these rates of success haven't moved much in the pharma industry overall in the past 15 years despite much scientific progress. Because if you really think about it, it's incredible that we find any human medicine at all, given the human body -- the product of billions of years of evolution -- is an incredibly complex system we do not fully understand.\n\nYet the business of the pharma industry and Novartis in particular -- which covers everything from generics to innovative medicines (next-gen therapeutics such as cell and gene therapies like CAR-T for cancer and more) is not that different from other large enterprises when it comes to managing R&D, pipelines of ideas and pipelines of talent, and more. So how does the world's largest producer of medicines in the world in terms of volume -- 70. billion. doses. a. year. -- balance the science and the business of innovation? How does an enterprise at such vast scale make decisions about what to focus on, what to build vs. buy? Given the fast pace of science today, what happens to deep expertise that would normally take many decades to build up?\n\nIn this conversation, a16z bio general partners Jorge Conde and Vijay Pande with Sonal Chokshi interview Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis. Narasimhan takes us on a sweeping tour from small molecules to large molecules to proteins and other modalities for making medicines. In other words, we're moving from chemistry to the cell and gene-engineered world. So where does tech come in? How can small startups engage such big pharma companies? How can bio entrepreneurs work backwards not just from trials and approvals but from reimbursement/ payers/  market value signals? And finally -- what should all scientific (and technical) leaders know when it comes to leadership? We discuss all this and more in this episode of the a16z Podcast, recorded recently on the road while at the J.P.M. health conference in San Francisco.",

      "title": "a16z Podcast | The API Economy -- The Why, What, and How",
      "description": "APIs (application programming interfaces), observe the guests in this episode of the a16z Podcast, can be described as everything from Lego building blocks to Tetris to front doors to even veins in the human body. Because the defining property of APIs is that they're ways to send and receive information between different parts, that is, communicate between software applications (which often map onto different organizational functions/services in a company too). APIs therefore give companies access to data and competencies they wouldn't otherwise have -- or better yet, that they no longer need -- by letting even non-tech and small companies combine these building blocks to get exactly what they want.\n\nWhich means companies today -- including non-tech companies and small companies -- can focus on their core competency instead, access bigger data, and get superpowers to scale and compete with the Amazons of the world. But what does all this mean for design -- after all, APIs are interfaces between software, not people -- and for other stakeholders (finance, ops, etc.) beyond developers? Who do you sell to? How are APIs changing not only the (inter)face of business today, but how entire companies are being formed from -- or around -- them? This conversation considers all this and more, featuring: Cristina Cordova, who leads partnerships for Stripe, which builds infrastructure for the movement of money including payments processing; Augusto Marietti, CEO and co-founder of Kong, which helps companies manage secure APIs and microservices; Laura Behrens Wu, CEO and co-founder of Shippo, which powers multi-carrier shipping for all kinds of commerce; in conversation with Sonal Chokshi.",

How do you sort the wheat from the chaff?\n\nAnd beyond the event of CES itself, Evans and Sinofsky analyze the experimentation we're beginning to see in connected consumer electronics for the home. When it comes to the smart home, it seems as though more is better -- more devices, more connectivity, and a single network to rule them all -- but that isn't the case. How (and when) will these devices and appliances -- some of which you only buy new every 10-20 years -- all connect into one system, and what will that platform look like? Which devices will we actually need to be \"smart\", and what will be today's equivalent of the electric carving knife? Where will new kinds of UI come in; when will a simple GO button be the better option? All this and more in this episode.",

      "description": "“The only unforgivable sin in business is to run out of cash” [so said Harold Geneen], yet startup CEOs “always act on leading indicators of good news, and lagging indicators of bad news” [according to Andy Grove]; after all, it requires a certain stubborn, headstrong optimism to start a company. So how to reconcile these views? At the very least, pay more attention to leading indicators of running out of cash, “because there’s just no going back”!\n\nBut doing all this — while also trying to balance growth, advance planning vs. constantly changing strategy, revenue vs. margin, coordination/communication/culture, and so on — is a lot harder than it seems on a finance spreadsheet. It requires understanding that the “math is not the terrain, the spreadsheet is not the business”… yet also knowing when to trade rose-colored glasses for darker rainy-day ones.\n\nAnd that's where a CEO partnering productively with a CFO comes in. In this episode of the a16z Podcast -- moderated by (and based on an internal event for CEOs+CFOs hosted by) Caroline Moon, who leads the financial operations for startups practice on a16z's corp dev team -- Ben Horowitz and Scott Kupor share their personal insights as well as advice for founders: How DO you do it all?",

But it’s the judicial branch — the courts — that often gets the final say on key technology policy questions of the day… Like encryption, among many others.\n\nAnd now, there’s a new Supreme Court justice in town (Neil Gorsuch, who was sworn in last month) — how does that change judicial decision making around tech policy? Finally, is the growing trend of tech companies writing and signing amicus briefs (or otherwise engaging with the courts) for high-profile policy issues a good or bad thing for their employees, shareholders, and others?\n\nOne thing is clear, though: The tech sector is getting more and more involved in policy issues, and is arguably becoming a “fourth branch” of government (or perhaps even a “fifth estate”) with its own checks and balances. Or so argue the guests in this episode of the a16z Podcast | Karen Dunn, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner (who has also been a consultant on the TV show House of Cards); and Erin Murphy, partner at Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, D.C. (recently recognized by National Law Journal as “a rising star”); in conversation with Ted Ullyot, who heads up Andreessen Horowitz’ Policy and Regulatory Affairs operation (and was formerly in both industry, as a general counsel at Facebook, and government, himself). The discussion took place as part our annual a16z Tech Policy Summit, in Washington, D.C., earlier this month.",

But without enough opportunity, we're all at risk on all sides of the ideological spectrum. And actually, both the \"tech is stupid\" and \"tech is evil\" narratives are true... in different sectors [hint: those afflicted by Baumol’s cost disease]. So what then are the roles for policymakers and and entrepreneurs in addressing these issues, including jobs?\n\nUltimately, Andreessen argues, success in Silicon Valley isn't really about good idea vs. bad idea at all … and it's all eventually political. (Bonus: why Andreessen stopped tweeting!)",

This conversation covers the most interesting enterprise use cases for commercial drones, where we are in the introduction of drones into the consumer and commercial space (including the most interesting enterprise use cases for commercial drones), and how the industry will scale.\n\nDowney, Jordan, and Russell parse out what the new FAA regulation means big picture for drones and airspace, and what’s been overlooked. Regulation, says Grant, is just one element. What do we want our drone future to look like — where we want them flying and where we don't — and how will our responses to consumer and commercial drones affect each other? What are the privacy and safety implications, and how do we navigate them?",

It's not only about \"thought leadership\", either... a personal brand can also provide a filter for choosing what to do (and what not to do), as well as define your aspirations for where you want to go next. Even if you cringe at the idea of putting yourself in the spotlight.\n\nThis conversation, moderated by a16z partner Hanne Tidnam, was recorded as part of the BreakLine Tech program for military veterans, an immersive education program for veterans transitioning into new careers (including a week of talks and courses hosted at Andreessen Horowitz).",

The modern day physical is downright spartan in what it captures, not to mention that we're using 200-year old tools to capture that very limited data.\n\nWhich is why we need to borrow from other domains of science and data and apply that to our bodies, in more ways than one, argues Q founder and CEO Jeffrey Kaditz with a16z bio fund general partner Vijay Pande (in conversation with Sonal Chokshi) on this episode of the a16z Podcast. But how do we get there? What would data \"rights\" look like -- and could we possibly donate data much like we currently donate organs? And for catching diseases like prostate or breast cancer early, how can we use data captured over multiple points in time -- something not really done right now in medicine -- to be more predictive, sensitive, and specific beyond so-called \"representative\" population samples? What IS a 'diagnostic', really, anyway?",

But isn't the very point of technology to make our lives more comfortable? Yes... until \"we\" -- whether an entire class, generation, ethnic group, or country like the U.S. -- become a little too complacent. Or so argues Tyler Cowen in his new book, The Complacent Class: The Self-Defeating Quest for the American Dream.\n\nWe've even outsourced our mobility to immigrants, observes Cowen (who is also a prolific economics blogger, columnist, and professor at George Mason University and director of the Mercatus Center there). Which is great... until you realize we're also giving up so much of that dynamism ourselves. This complacency affects everything from how economies to corporations to individuals grow, and we discuss how in this episode of the a16z Podcast (with Alex Rampell and Sonal Chokshi).\n\n\"The general problem is that 'veto points' build up in a lot of systems as they grow larger and more bureaucratic.\" That's why we have NIMBYism (and a bunch of other such -isms). Corporate cash becomes the new stagnant pool (watch out for those mosquitos!). The stability of real estate becomes a trap. Social media (and even some protest) becomes signaling vs. actually doing something. As for culture: Who defines it? And is it time to bring back the individual quest?",

      "description": "The Industrial Revolution (and period between 1500-1700) was an unprecedented age of technology and economic progress — not unlike today’s, in fact — where we took “quantum leaps” forward in tech by taming electricity, making cheaper steel and refining iron cheaply, automating fiber looms, pumping water out of coal mines, figuring out how to measure longitude at sea, improving the quality of food, preventing smallpox, … even bleaching underwear.\n\nBut what really triggered the Industrial Revolution? Why did it take place in Europe and spread beyond? It has to do with a competitive, open market of ideas — a transnational “Republic of Letters”, not unlike the early days of the blogosphere. And the conditions that created it (virtual networks, open access science, weak ties, and so on) are the very conditions we may need to sustain growth and prosperity even today, argues Joel Mokyr, professor of economics and history at Northwestern and author of the new book A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.\n\nDespite fears of what new tech may bring, the alternative to not innovating is stagnation — “not doing it is worse”, argues Mokyr in this episode of the a16z Podcast. So how do we then measure that growth? How does this all play out internationally, and institutionally? And what happens when we bring shared focus to big problems, like climate change? If there’s one pattern that continues to play out throughout history to today, it’s that “Knowledge builds technology and technology builds knowledge.”\n\nimage: Library of Congress",

      "description": "You've heard a version of this story before: Steve Jobs calls some executive out of the blue to come work for him. Only this time the story turns out great ... and the company wasn't Apple. This episode of the a16z Podcast shares some of the journey that former CFO Lawrence Levy went on with Steve Jobs as they took Pixar -- a company then on the verge of failure -- to its IPO and subsequent greatest hits.\n\nIt's sort of an adventure story but is really more of a quest for product-market fit. How did they figure out a model for such an old-but-new business (i.e., animation and entertainment)? How did they take an improbable plan and figure out how to make it work -- both qualitatively and quantitatively? How did they then navigate and straddle the diverse worlds of Silicon Valley, Hollywood, and Wall Street? And finally, how did they price their IPO, which was also a symbol of Steve Jobs' comeback story ... a narrative that's sometimes lost in the Apple story.\n\nFrom the business of creativity to corporate culture, Levy -- former CFO of Pixar, board member, and author of the new book To Pixar and Beyond: My Unlikely Journey with Steve Jobs to Make Entertainment History -- shares his (and Jobs' untold) story. But it isn't just a story about finding the right model and numbers to build, explain, and measure the business; it's also, partly, about how to get the measure of one's humanity, too.",

      "description": "Just as \"social networking\" is a bland term that doesn't really capture the layers of what happens underneath (and on top of) social networking platforms, \"crowdfunding\" is a broader phenomenon than what the term and tools implies. Or so argue the guests on this episode of the a16z Podcast, Tilt co-founder and CEO James Beshara and a16z general partner Jeff Jordan with Sonal Chokshi.\n\nCrowdfunding isn't just about reaching a certain threshold to make something, but it's also about \"pre-commerce\" or \"pretail\" -- the next evolution in commerce, which involves the ability to suss out demand before production and sell directly to consumers. Crowdfunding is also about \"social commerce\" -- the ability to not only build community, but trigger collective action towards some goal. There's even a sort of Dunbar's number equivalent for crowdfunding, the tipping point at which the momentum of this collective action takes over (hint: it involves the magic number of 34%).\n\nBeyond crowdfunding, there are broader themes of economic change and behavior at play here -- whether it's people's tolerance for waiting and buying something before it exists; a new type of scarcity and desire for experiential buying; or makers creating or co-creating things publicly, and even incompletely. All we know is that we're at a watershed moment of sorts -- as evidenced by car manufacturer Tesla's pre-orders for its Model 3, which is not even going to be available for a few years. And yet...!",

      "title": "a16z Podcast | Beyond One Size Fits All for Startup Employee Options",
      "description": "Do we need a new pay system for the way startup employees are compensated? While many people agree that the current 90-day exercise practice — an outdated relic of when companies used to go public/get liquidity in a much shorter timeframe — is far from ideal, neither are some of the other solutions proposed so far. Because incentives matter, and behavior follows incentives. Which is fine as long as you know all the implications around what you’re incentivizing for and it aligns to what you want as a founder for your company and employees.\n\nSo “let’s get it out from under the rug, let’s talk about it, and let’s design a system that works for whatever you want your company to be”, argue a16z partners Ben Horowitz and Scott Kupor in this episode of the a16z Podcast. The discussion goes beyond just the question of a 10-year exercise to other configurations — such as Snapchat’s model and Tesla’s model for timing options, as well as radical experiments like “progressive equity“. What are the tradeoffs of each approach? How does the type of company you’re building (a complex hardware or infrastructure-heavy startup for example) change things? How does the broader environment affect all these considerations (and might plans to create a new long-term stock exchange help)?\n\nFinally, is it fair to treat tenure as a proxy for the actual value a particular employee contributed to building the company? Or to optimize for earlier vs. later employees, particular if the earlier ones de-risked the company and later ones helped scale it? And what do different employees want — more options, more RSUs, cash, more ownership, more stability, more mobility? All this and more in this episode…",

This would in turn allow endless (and entirely new) use cases to be built on top of the blockchain, whether smart contracts or \"app coins\" that allow decentralized crowdfunding and decentralized business models. The results, at first glance, may seem just like a new way of financing a company. But it actually goes much deeper than that: They're really software protocols that are almost replacing centralized companies or what those companies would do. The possibilities are endless...\n\nIn this episode of the a16z Podcast, Ethereum inventor and co-creator Vitalik Buterin joins Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase (an a16z portfolio company) in conversation with Chris Dixon.

This year London has bragging rights, but does being the word's center of gravity for finance mean so-called \"fintech\" companies will naturally flow from that position?\n\nLondon-based investor Eileen Burbidge joins a16z's Alex Rampell to pick apart fintech in this segment of the podcast recorded on our U.K. road trip. Everything from the term (please make it go away), to the particular barriers and opportunities facing entrepreneurs looking to create what really amounts to better banks.",

      "description": "As software becomes core to every industry, there is a need for more and more software development across practically every department in a company. But as anyone who has tried to get quality software developed knows, that has given rise to a supply and demand problem.\n\nLeveraging open source software is a big part of the solution to that problem, but venturing into the open source world raises all sorts of questions for most companies. For example, how do you engage as a company in the open source community; what are your obligations to the project; and if you are hiring a development team what clues ought you to be looking for to get the best developers? And what are the developers looking for?\n\nAnd in the end, who’s responsible and accountable for the all this code flowing around?\n\nIn a discussion from the firm’s 2015 Tech Summit, Steven Sinofsky digs into all those questions with a panel that includes Roger Dickey, founder and CEO of Gigster, Slack CMO Bill Macaitis, GitHub Director of Field Services Matthew McCullough, and Joel Spolsky, co-founder and CEO of StackOverflow.",

What if you could get the most out of your mind and brain -- or more scientifically, your \"cognitive performance\" -- without going to those old addictive standbys like coffee or RedBulls?\n\nThe promise of nootropics or cognitive enhancers is to help us work better and more productively (for example, through more stamina and working memory); stay more awake and alert (without the sudden jolt of coffee); sleep better; and even protect our brains against cognitive impairments or neuro diseases like Alzheimer's.\n\nGeoffrey Woo and Michael Brandt, the founders of Nootrobox, believe that nootropics are possible for everyone -- not just for a select or hobbyist fringe of society -- and that part of that mainstreaming will involve a lot of hard science, hard data, and frankly, good user experience and better packaging of raw components ... the same things, in fact, that helped mainstream personal computers from the days of the early hacking at the Homebrew Club to Apple and the world of mass computing today. But how does nootropics move beyond a community movement ... and how does it fit into the context of other trends such as biohacking, quantified self, and more? Is the human body really the next 'platform'? All this and more on this episode of the a16z Podcast.",

      "description": "It's a myth that startups happen in isolation. Those legendary two people in a garage are often building on the deep and basic research -- long funded by government and conducted in universities -- that has come before it. But with the advent of the internet, what's the future of peer-to-peer collaborations and startups-as-\"science experiments\"? Can venture capital disrupt academia… and vice versa? And finally, what's the secret to universities like Stanford making money off the entrepreneurial ideas coming out of them? (Hint: It starts with a 'p'. But not what you think.)\n\na16z's new professor in residence Vijay Pande interviews Marc Andreessen at our recent Academic summit on these topics, as well as 'regulatory arbitrage', how to mix humanities and science, and what Marc would have majored in if he were 18 today.",

Now that large enterprise networks routinely include hundreds of thousands of nodes it’s amazingly difficult and time-consuming (we’re talking days often) to get definitive answers to seemingly simple questions like, how many PCs do I have running? Never mind, how many PCs do I have that could be at risk of the Heartbleed virus? Tanium, the most recent company to join the a16z portfolio, offers a systems management and security tool that allows administrators to ask virtually any question about the configuration, performance, and complexion of an enterprise network and get an answer in seconds. Tanium CTO and Co-founder Orion Hindawi and a16z Board Partner Steven Sinofsky discuss the origins of Tanium; the invention of the “linear peer-to-peer communications” architecture that turbo-charges the Tanium solution; and with Internet of Things coming online fast, the prospect of networks quickly going to millions and billions of nodes.",

So in this talk, a16z general partner Angela Strange describes how pooling risk changes as we reinvent a legacy business like insurance through technology.

So getting channel distribution and partnerships right really matters for the “little guys” — i.e., startups. But when does a channel partnership make the most sense for you? How do you determine who the appropriate (and most beneficial) channel partners are? How does channel pricing work, and when can you offer different “channel economics”?\n\nBefore joining a16z, General Partner Alex Rampell ran a company called TrialPay (which was acquired by Visa). Using the case study/example of TrialPay in this deck -- first presented at one of our company building events in early 2017 -- Rampell shares how you can best use channel partnerships to grow your business … including understanding what they can do and what they can’t.",

      "description": "When a technical founder creates a widget, their de facto stance too often is that it has intrinsic value that’s surely obvious — that people will not only understand what’s important about that widget, but also the dollar value attached to it. The reality is: No matter how cool that widget is, until you go to market, it doesn’t exist. This is especially true when trying to CREATE, not just enter, an existing market category.\n\nIn this deck, presented at one of our company building events in early 2017, Martin Casado (who was part of the a16z portfolio) shares the how, when, and what of pricing (hint: do NOT set the price too early or too low!); marketing to early markets (especially given the rise of the developer as buyer); and finally, what kind of sales motion you need and when to deploy it. Casado shares these lessons learned as part of his own journey, from a PhD to co-founder of Nicira, which was acquired by VMWare and would eventually run up to a $1B business and even “greater potential strategic opportunity”.\n\nBut in many ways, says Casado, this is a deck about his failures. From a technical background, building a company can be very non-intuitive. This is not a block-and-tackle business school lecture (which tend to look only backwards, and to focus mature markets) — it’s about how do you get your “magic beans”, this amazing thing you’ve created, to market, to market. And not just into the market, but how to get that market to understand, and value the magic. For technical founders starting on your journey with your own magic beans, this is the roadmap you’ll need.",

      "title": "Crypto and the Evolution of Open Source",
      "description": "The open source movement enabled so much in computing, including the collaborative building of libraries -- that is, building blocks of code that developers could combine together to build applications. But as these applications grew to massive scale, those libraries ended up being somewhat asymmetrical for \"nights-and-weekend\" developers (compared to say, the disproportionate resources of a large company with billions of users and big data).\n\nBlockchains, however -- enabled by cryptotokens that align incentives among stakeholders -- shift open source development from libraries, to the creation of shared, open, permissionless services. Instead of being siloed and repetitively produced as if from the industrial factory era, any smart contract developed on Ethereum becomes a shared service that can interact with any other service... incentivizing developers to improve on existing services, build on top of them, and enable combinatorial innovation at greater scale than ever before.\n\nBut if decentralized networks are to win the third era of the internet, how will we resolve challenges such as single-purpose services (another form of consolidation), community conflicts, and other issues? In this video, freelance software engineer (and blockchain app developer) and writer (and urban watcher) Devon Zuegel guest-interviews a16z crypto partners Denis Nazarov and Jesse Walden, the co-founders of Mediachain Labs (which was acquired by Spotify in 2017). They draw on their past experiences leading open source development of a decentralized media attribution protocol for connecting creators to their audience, and what the implications of \"services vs. libraries\" could be for creatives now. And what about identity, stablecoins and crypto finance, and more? Finally, they extend their previous analogy of cities and network effects and how it fits the idea of libraries vs. services in crypto.\n\n***\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

      "description": "Cryptonetworks are often compared to firms, people, or even coral reefs -- but, observes a16z crypto partner Ali Yahya, they might be much more similar to cities. Where does that analogy fit, and where does it break down? And what can we learn from how cities both emerge from the bottom up and are motivated by a top down vision/design  and apply to open source networks such as those in crypto?\n\nIn this video -- guest hosted by freelance software engineer (and blockchain app developer) and writer (and urban watcher) Devon Zuegel -- a16z crypto partners Denis Nazarov, Jesse Walden, and Yahya share their thoughts on \"rough consensus\"; shared myths and beliefs; modularity vs. monolithic design; and the rivers and riverbeds that people build cities and code around.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's all about mass coordination at scale... but what are the incentives for building the infrastructure and ecosystem, for running experiments but also determining governance as well?\n\n* * *\n\nPlease note that the a16z crypto fund is a separate legal entity managed by CNK Capital Management, L.L.C.

      "description": "Product and engineering lead the way with tech startups, as should HR, but unfortunately, this often means finance comes very last. Yet finance should come first -- or at least much, much sooner -- argues Caroline Moon, who runs a16z's financial operations practice (part of our corp dev team) for guiding startups.\n\nFinance is -- and should be! -- much more strategic than just bookkeeping. Speaking of, what is accounting? Startups should treat financial data much the same way they do product data: not just tracking and analyzing everything about it against KPIs, but also building out the data streams in a way that gets you answers to key questions. In fact, why not think of finance in much the same way one thinks of product management and product managers -- or as an agile process running on top of the company, making sure everything is moving in the right strategic direction?\n\nMoon doesn't stop there, though, sharing other helpful analogies to help technical and first-time CEOs think through the importance of finance, and more importantly, how to structure and when to build out a finance function (no matter what stage you're at). Especially because finance ties together all the things that startups run on: people, products, and cash.",

In other words, digital doesn't just affect physical; it now goes in the other direction, too. And the completion of this virtuous loop isn't just the holy grail of advertising and marketing for retailers and others, but is a new phenomenon, argues a16z partner Connie Chan, that she fittingly dubs online to offline \"2.0\".\n\nIn this short talk -- originally delivered at Wall Street Journal's D.Live Asia conference April 2018 -- Chan shares examples and experiments from China, as well as product insights and mindset shifts, behind what it means to go from \"mobile first\" to mobile only -- where one's phone isn't just an access point, but an entry point... And where even physical spaces, not just sites, could be personalized to us.",

      "description": "\"Infrastructure is dead\", some say, thanks to cloud computing -- and a couple large incumbents sucking out all the profits in this space. Er... not really. We're actually entering a renaissance of sorts -- a \"golden era of infrastructure\" -- and it's one that is biased towards startups. They're the ones who have the unfair advantage, argues a16z general partner (and former Nicira co-founder/CTO) Martin Casado in this talk.\nOne of the fathers of software-defined networking (SDN), Casado shares what happens when you put a \"software-defined\" in front of everything: No silo is safe. And it's not just storage; it's computing, networking, security, management, databases, analytics, development, and so on.\nSo how are enterprise applications evolving? Is it really similar to what happened with consumer tools? And what will it take for startups to truly take on incumbents in this space? In this talk, previously delivered at other industry events, Casado shares his thoughts on the future of infrastructure as well as views on how 3 important trends coming together: hardware to software; software to services; and finally, the rise of the developer...",

      "description": "Hardware’s in a really disruptive period right now, as we: (1) get more — but not faster — transistors (it’s the ‘end’ of Dennard scaling); and (2) move computing into sensors and other small devices in the Internet of Things. It’s all leading to specialization in hardware, from FPGAs to specialized processors and combinations.\n\nSo what does this mean for software? Well, we’ll need better system design and programming abstractions. But we’ll also need to embrace making these interfaces much more programmable — and by more people, with a programming model where you don’t have to be a PhD in computer science to use it.\n\nKathyrn McKinley is a principal researcher at Microsoft (and University of Texas at Austin professor) who focuses on programming language implementation; future architectures; and compilers that are a better match to current and future technology limits and constraints.
