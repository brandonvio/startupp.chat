      "description": "In this episode of FYI, ARK CEO Cathie Wood and Analyst Nick Grous sit down with Vlad Tenev, Co-Founder and CEO of Robinhood. Together they explore how Robinhood is redefining retail investing and financial services—from expanding access to private markets and tokenized assets to transforming its product ecosystem into a fintech super app.\nVlad discusses Robinhood’s long-term vision at the intersection of capitalism and democracy, why retail ownership matters more in the age of AI, and how the company is building around the upcoming $124 trillion generational wealth transfer. He also shares the strategic thinking behind Robinhood's expansion into credit, crypto, and international markets, including the development of its own blockchain and stablecoin.\nFinally, they explore the role of AI in Robinhood’s platform evolution, including the launch of Cortex, and the guiding philosophy behind the company’s product velocity and value-driven subscription model.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:11:10 Cathie and Vlad discuss how navigating the bear market made Robinhood and ARK stronger.\n00:13:25 Vlad outlines Robinhood’s mission and long-term opportunity to empower retail through ownership.\n00:17:28 ARK’s and Robinhood’s shared focus on expanding retail access to private markets through innovation and regulation.\n00:20:45 Why treating retail investors as a first-class constituency is an underutilized advantage for public companies.\n00:23:32 How Robinhood’s product velocity and innovation position it to capture assets during the $124T generational wealth shift.\n00:24:34 Designing features that work across extended families and using AI to eliminate frictions in moving assets between institutions.\n00:29:24 How the company decides when to partner, build in-house, or acquire based on speed, capability gaps, and strategic alignment.\n00:33:16 Vlad explains how Robinhood adapted its crypto strategy across regulatory cycles, culminating in its European tokenization launch.\n00:39:42 The internal \"aha moment\" that led to Robinhood’s push into tokenizing real-world assets—from equities to real estate.\n00:43:44 The tradeoff between adopting existing chains and owning the full product experience via Robinhood Chain.\n00:45:38 How Robinhood sees the stablecoin market evolving—especially in terms of yield, utility, and international access.\n00:52:40 Breaking down Robinhood’s growing credit product suite and the reasoning behind its Sage Home Loans partnership model.\n00:58:41 How Robinhood is using AI to simplify investing and help users understand market movements and options strategies.\n01:02:13 The extent to which Robinhood is using fine-tuned AI models across internal operations, especially customer service.\n01:04:49 Why the traditional view that retail investors aren’t “ready” for private markets no longer applies in the internet era.\n01:07:41 Vlad shares how the company is thinking about retention vs. pricing as Gold adoption scales.\n01:10:16 Cathie and Vlad reflect on the shared mission to educate investors and broaden access to financial innovation.\n\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://arkinv.st/ARKInvest\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nX: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94f",

      "description": "In this episode of the Brainstorm, Sam, Nick, and Director of Research, Digital Assets, Lorenzo Valente, dive into the latest developments from Coinbase, focusing on the launch of the BASE app. They explore the three pillars of the BASE ecosystem: BASE chain, BASE build, and BASE app, and discuss how these innovations aim to enhance user experience with faster transactions, developer tools, and a reimagined non-custodial wallet. The conversation also touches on the integration of social media and financial markets, the evolving landscape of crypto trading, and the potential for new user engagement.\n\nIf you know ARK, then you probably know about our long-term research projections, like estimating where we will be 5-10 years from now! But just because we are long-term investors, doesn’t mean we don’t have strong views and opinions on breaking news. In fact, we discuss and debate this every day. So now we’re sharing some of these internal discussions with you in our new video series, “The Brainstorm”, a co-production from ARK and Public.com. Tune in every week as we react to the latest in innovation. Here and there we’ll be joined by special guests, but ultimately this is our chance to join the conversation and share ARK’s quick takes on what’s going on in tech today.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n00:00:00 Coinbase Launches ‘Base’ App\n00:02:28 The ‘Everything’ App\n00:04:17 The Race Toward Crypto Wallet Dominance\n00:07:04 Social Media X Financial Markets\n00:10:52 Who’s Really Pushing Crypto Prices Upward?\n00:12:40 The Digital Wallet Revolution\n\nFor more updates on Public.com:\nWebsite: https://public.com/\nYouTube: @publicinvest\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/public \n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://arkinv.st/ARKInvest\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\n- X: https://arkinv.st/Twitter\n- LinkedIn: https://arkinv.st/LinkedIn\n- Facebook: https://arkinv.st/Facebook\n- Instagram: https://arkinv.st/Instagram\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "description": "Brett Winton and ARK analyst Jozef Soja dive deep into the rapidly evolving world of AI agents—software entities that are increasingly automating enterprise functions like customer support. They explore why AI agents are gaining traction, how they’re priced, and the potential for a new kind of agent-versus-agent arms race between companies and consumers. Later in the episode, they’re joined by Dr. Alan Bekker, founder of eSelf.ai and former Head of Conversational AI at Snap, who shares his journey from building voice agents for call centers to launching a real-time, face-to-face AI tutoring platform.

      "description": "In this episode of FYI – For Your Innovation, ARK's Director of Research Brett Winton sits down with Brad Feld — co-founder of Foundry, Techstars, and longtime venture capitalist — to unpack his latest thinking on startup communities, mentorship, and how founders can build better networks by giving first. After taking time away from public life to reflect, Brad returns with a new book, Give First: The Power of Mentorship, and a sharpened view on the distinction between transactional ecosystems and community-led innovation. He shares lessons from nearly two decades with Techstars, thoughts on remote vs. in-person work post-COVID, and how mentorship can be redesigned for the next generation of entrepreneurs. The conversation also explores the cultural shifts introduced by AI, the hidden friction in monetizing online engagement, and why Brad believes the best way to shape a network is to invest in others before you know what you’ll get in return.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n00:00:00 Why Brad Feld “hibernated” from public life and how it changed his perspective\n00:04:24 From default yes to default no: Reclaiming time and creative energy\n00:06:28 Navigating remote work: Company culture and post-COVID office dynamics\n00:09:49 When revenue goes negative: COVID-era crisis stories from Rover and SeatGeek\n00:12:25 The Give First philosophy — and how it became Techstars’ guiding principle\n00:17:50 Finding mentorship as a founder: What works and what definitely doesn’t\n00:19:15 The power of peer mentorship and showing up without expectations\n00:23:16 How online culture’s transactional mindset erodes community trust\n00:26:00 Boulder Startup Week and the importance of local founder energy\n00:30:41 Brad’s Random Day tradition: 15-minute meetings, one goal per person\n00:35:17 Techstars vs. YC: Origins of the mentor-driven accelerator model\n00:40:27 Building startup communities from scratch: What actually works\n00:46:05 Founders must lead: Differentiating between startup communities and ecosystems\n00:49:00 Mentorship at scale: Applying Techstars’ playbook to community growth\n00:54:08 Frictionless networks: Why “Give First” accelerates stronger connections\n01:00:16 AI’s impact on software development, legal workflows, and personal productivity\n01:04:07 Coding with AI: Brad’s firsthand experience building a web app with Cursor\n\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://arkinv.st/ARKInvest\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nX: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94f",

      "description": "In this episode of FYI – For Your Innovation, Brett Winton and ARK analyst Nemo Despot sit down with Generate Biomedicines CEO Mike Nally and CFO Jason Silvers to explore how generative AI is transforming the discovery and development of protein-based therapeutics. Founded in 2018 by Flagship Pioneering, Generate Biomedicines is building a “self-driving lab” that combines machine learning, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and high-throughput wet lab automation to dramatically accelerate drug development. The conversation dives into how Generate is reimagining protein therapeutics — going beyond trial-and-error methods to a data-first, design-driven model for creating novel medicines. The team discusses the company’s proprietary approach to integrating structural biology with functional data, the economic implications of reducing time-to-market from 13 years to under 9, and how their platform could unlock treatments for diseases that have been historically undruggable. They also touch on strategic partnerships, scalability, and how AI is shifting the biotech business model from artisanal science to an industrialized, data-driven enterprise.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n00:00:00 Intro\n00:01:30 Why Generate Biomedicines is rethinking protein drug discovery from first principles\n00:04:40 How their structure-first approach differs from peers like AbSci and Recursion\n00:07:04 Using cryo-EM to build proprietary protein interaction datasets\n00:10:57 Traditional drug discovery is random, expensive, and inefficient — here’s how Generate is changing that\n00:16:58 From concept to clinic in 18–24 months: Accelerating timelines through AI\n00:20:47 Going beyond efficiency: Unlocking access to undruggable biology\n00:24:48 Turning cryo-EM into a high-throughput data engine for model training\n00:31:20 The long-term vision: Patient-specific protein therapeutics\n00:40:00 Why scalability gives Generate an edge over traditional biotech\n00:47:52 The future of biotech as a research & development (R&D) sharing economy\n00:54:19 Adapting fast: Keeping pace with generative AI advances across the stack\n01:00:16 The KPI (key performance indicator) for platform success: Rate of improvement\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://arkinv.st/ARKInvest\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nX: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94f",

      "description": "We’re entering the AI battle arena today! Sam Korus and Nicholas Grous are joined by ARK Director of Research, Next Generation Internet, Frank Downing, to dive into the performance of three leading AI models: ChatGPT, Deepseek, and Grok. They conduct real-time tests to evaluate how well these models can analyze stock market trends and solve puzzles. The conversation also touches on the implications of quantum computing and how it relates to AI advancements. Throughout the discussion, the hosts emphasize the importance of user experience and the varying strengths of each AI model, ultimately providing insights into their performance and usability.\n\nIf you know ARK, then you probably know about our long-term research projections, like estimating where we will be 5-10 years from now! But just because we are long-term investors, doesn’t mean we don’t have strong views and opinions on breaking news. In fact, we discuss and debate this every day. So now we’re sharing some of these internal discussions with you in our new video series, “The Brainstorm”, a co-production from ARK and Public.com. Tune in every week as we react to the latest in innovation. Here and there we’ll be joined by special guests, but ultimately this is our chance to join the conversation and share ARK’s quick takes on what’s going on in tech today.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n00:00:00 Intro\n00:00:12 Intelligence Battle: ARK Puts AI Models To The Test\n00:02:17 Part 1: Testing Web Search Capabilities\n00:04:50 Part 2: Solving Puzzles\n00:14:16 Part 3: Testing Reasoning Capabilities\n00:19:00 AI Competition Takeaways\n\nFor more updates on Public.com:\nWebsite: https://public.com/\nYouTube: @publicinvest\nX: https://twitter.com/public \n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://arkinv.st/ARKInvest\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\n- X: https://arkinv.st/Twitter\n- LinkedIn: https://arkinv.st/LinkedIn\n- Facebook: https://arkinv.st/Facebook\n- Instagram: https://arkinv.st/Instagram\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

This week, Autonomous Technology and Robotics Director of Research Sam Korus and Associate Portfolio Manager Nicholas Grous are joined by ARK Research Associate Lorenzo Valente to discuss the recent developments in the tokenization of real-world assets, particularly through Tether's new platform, Hadron. The discussion highlights the significance of stablecoins in the global economy and their potential to democratize access to financial products. The second part of the conversation shifts to the rise of new social media platforms like Bluesky and Threads, exploring their user engagement and the evolving landscape of real-time information sharing.\n\nIf you know ARK, then you probably know about our long-term research projections, like estimating where we will be 5-10 years from now! But just because we are long-term investors, doesn’t mean we don’t have strong views and opinions on breaking news. In fact, we discuss and debate this every day. So now we’re sharing some of these internal discussions with you in our new video series, “The Brainstorm”, a co-production from ARK and Public.com. Tune in every week as we react to the latest in innovation. Here and there we’ll be joined by special guests, but ultimately this is our chance to join the conversation and share ARK’s quick takes on what’s going on in tech today.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n00:00:00 Intro\n00:00:16 Tokenization Of The Real World\n00:09:26 Emergence Of New Social Media Platforms\n00:18:12 A Post-Election Surge For ‘Text-First’ Social Platforms\n\n\nFor more updates on Public.com:\nWebsite: https://public.com/\nYouTube: @publicinvest\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/public \n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://arkinv.st/ARKInvest\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\n- Twitter: https://arkinv.st/Twitter\n- LinkedIn: https://arkinv.st/LinkedIn\n- Facebook: https://arkinv.st/Facebook\n- Instagram: https://arkinv.st/Instagram\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "description": "Can you imagine a future without Google? This week, Autonomous Technology and Robotics Director of Research Sam Korus and Associate Portfolio Manager Nick Grous are joined by ARK Chief Futurist Brett Winton to discuss the competitive landscape of AI search engines and the implications for Google, as well as the emerging business opportunities in curing rare diseases through innovative therapies.\n\nIf you know ARK, then you probably know about our long-term research projections, like estimating where we will be 5-10 years from now!

Tune in every week as we react to the latest in innovation. Here and there we’ll be joined by special guests, but ultimately this is our chance to join the conversation and share ARK’s quick takes on what’s going on in tech today.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n00:00:00 Intro\n00:00:16 Is Google’s Profit Center Under Attack?\n00:05:10 Democratization Of Search\n00:10:30 Is Google’s Profit Center Under Attack?\n00:17:58 The Business Of Cures\n00:20:30 Mispricing Medicine\n00:22:22 The Economics Of Cures\n00:26:37 A Heavy Dose Of Innovation\n\n\nFor more updates on Public.com:\nWebsite: https://public.com/\nYouTube: @publicinvest\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/public \n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://arkinv.st/ARKInvest\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\n- Twitter: https://arkinv.st/Twitter\n- LinkedIn: https://arkinv.st/LinkedIn\n- Facebook: https://arkinv.st/Facebook\n- Instagram: https://arkinv.st/Instagram\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

This week, Autonomous Technology and Robotics Director of Research Sam Korus and Associate Portfolio Manager Nick Grous are joined by ARK Research Associate Lorenzo Valente to discuss the TON network, whether Moore’s law is still applicable today, and the proliferation of AI across industries.\n\nIf you know ARK, then you probably know about our long-term research projections, like estimating where we will be 5-10 years from now! But just because we are long-term investors, doesn’t mean we don’t have strong views and opinions on breaking news. In fact, we discuss and debate this every day. So now we’re sharing some of these internal discussions with you in our new video series, “The Brainstorm”, a co-production from ARK and Public.com. Tune in every week as we react to the latest in innovation. Here and there we’ll be joined by special guests, but ultimately this is our chance to join the conversation and share ARK’s quick takes on what’s going on in tech today.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n00:00:00 Intro\n00:00:32 TON Blockchain Network\n00:08:11 Is Moore’s Law Dead?\n00:14:43 Will Artificial Intelligence Be Integrated Into Every Industry?\n\nFor more updates on Public.com:\nWebsite: https://public.com/\nYouTube: @publicinvest\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/public \n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://arkinv.st/ARKInvest\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\n- Twitter: https://arkinv.st/Twitter\n- LinkedIn: https://arkinv.st/LinkedIn\n- Facebook: https://arkinv.st/Facebook\n- Instagram: https://arkinv.st/Instagram\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "description": "Since inception, ARK has researched and published thoughts on the cryptocurrency ecosystem within Big Ideas and through articles, whitepapers, monthly Bitcoin reports and podcasts. Now, in coordination with Bitcoin Park, ARK is pleased to introduce a monthly conversation with leaders in the Bitcoin space, to discuss everything happening in the rapidly-changing and still nascent Bitcoin ecosystem. Published through the For Your innovation podcast channels, this monthly series aims to be informative and enlightening, including experts with diverse viewpoints.\n\nGuests on this month’s Bitcoin Brainstorm include:\nWill Reeves: CEO, Fold\nMark (Murch) Erhardt: Research Engineer, Chaincode Labs\nHarry Sudock: Chief Strategy Officer, GRIID\nMike Colyer: CEO, Foundry\nYassine Elmandjra: Director of Digital Assets, ARK Invest \nCathie Wood: Founder, CEO and CIO, ARK Invest\nRod Roudi: Co-Founder, Bitcoin Park\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n00:00:00 Intro\n00:01:00 Rod introduces the Bitcoin Brainstorm and hands over the floor to each of our fantastic guests\n00:05:29 What does this bitcoin halving represent as symbolic of bitcoin as a monetary system\n00:11:28 Bitcoin’s monetary policy is really just five lines of code\n00:27:27 Why, to understand bitcoin, you have to move out of the realm of human invention and into the world of physics and math to find things that have this level of predictability\n00:32:10 How bitcoin mining pools shifted from a Chinese dominated space to a more decentralized business and what can be done to continue decentralization\n00:39:34 How do companies like Foundry, a mining pool, and GRIID, a bitcoin miner, work together and what is Stratum V2?\n00:49:10 Could generative artificial intelligence (AI) be helpful in bitcoin development and bitcoin mining?\n00:53:49 Why one of bitcoin’s biggest benefits is its probabilistic protocol and that the asset class cannot be “gamed”\n00:56:35 Why the Gamestop short squeeze during the pandemic reminds Harry of bitcoin\n01:01:28 With a Bitcoin epoch people usually mean a period of roughly 4 years with a specific mining reward. With a bitcoin halving just behind us, what do our guests expect to happen in this next epoch?\n\nLinks Mentioned in this Episode:\nLearn more about Bitcoin Park: bitcoinpark.com",

Several trends are accelerating the shift to digital leisure:\n• Connected TV (CTV) Advertising should grow 17% at a compound annual rate, from $25 billion in 2023 to $73 billion in 2030.\n• Social Commerce should grow 32% at an annual rate, from $730 billion today to over $5 trillion in 2030.\n• Sports Betting should remain turbocharged by the legalization of online/mobile betting.\n• AI-assisted Video Game Creation is the new wave in gaming, building on user-generated platforms like Roblox, which has hosted more than ~470 million experiences globally—52x the combined number of PC, consoles, and mobile games.\n• AI-enabled Hardware could redefine personal wearable computing, especially if virtual reality (VR) continues to face challenges.\n\nA tradition since 2017, “Big Ideas” is ARK’s seminal document, offering a comprehensive analysis of technological convergence and its potential to revolutionize industries and economies at a global scale.

At the heart of this report lies thorough research, meticulously conducted by ARK's investment team.\n\nDownload Big Ideas 2024 Report: https://ark-invest.com/big-ideas-2024/\n\nDisclosure: https://www.ark-invest.com/terms\n\nImportant Information:\nBitcoin is a relatively new asset class, and the market for bitcoin is subject to rapid changes and uncertainty. Bitcoin is largely unregulated and bitcoin investments may be more susceptible to fraud and manipulation than more regulated investments. Bitcoin is subject to unique and substantial risks, including significant price volatility and lack of liquidity, and theft.\n\nBitcoin is subject to rapid price swings, including as a result of actions and statements by influencers and the media, changes in the supply of and demand for bitcoin, and other factors. There is no assurance that bitcoin will maintain its value over the long term.\n\nThe information provided in Big Ideas is based on ARK’s research and is not intended to be investment advice. ARK researches the utility of bitcoin as an investment in order to determine its potential future value as presented on the following slides. This material does not constitute, either explicitly or implicitly, any provision of services or products by ARK, and investors should determine for themselves whether a particular investment management service is suitable for their investment needs.

      "description": "On today’s episode, Research Associate Andrew Kim interviews Joris Henson, who pulls back the curtain on Deutsche Bank's approach to open banking, revealing valuable insights into the evolution of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and giving us a taste of what the future might hold for this trailblazing sector. Joris will share stories about incredibly creative approaches he's taken, like data cocktail bars and design thinking workshops, to identify needs and generate ideas. We'll take a closer look at the Open Finance Framework in the European Union, contrast Meta's reception against open banking, and ponder the potential impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in finance. Plus, Joris busts open the proverbial black box of airline points to reveal how AI could simplify complexities and discusses product innovation at Deutsche Bank, specifically DB Smart Access. \n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n- Overview of Deutsche Bank\n- API vision evolution and open banking opportunities before and after Payment Services Directive Two (PSD2)\n- How understanding niche products and successful partnerships accelerated open banking\n- How Third-party data needs grew from transaction details to comprehensive finance APIs\n- Future fintech may reduce data moats but emphasize innovative product development\n- Open banking in Europe prioritizes consent and trust over ad-driven models\n- How hackathons and practical demos were key in advancing open banking innovation\n- Aggregators gain value by integrating diverse APIs in open banking evolution\n- Life-centric products integrate finance with everyday activities like home energy\n- Why evolving consumer consent may balance security with convenience for AI use\n- AI financial advisors could offer tax and asset management insights affordably\n- Investors should watch how banks adapt to open banking and leverage APIs\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://arkinv.st/ARKInvest\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "description": "When ARK CEO and CIO Cathie Wood was discussing Bitcoin and Digital Assets in general with her mentor and famed economist Dr. Arthur Laffer, he told her that it reminded him of an era before the Federal Reserve existed. This idea spurred Cathie to invite Dr. Laffer on the FYI podcast to further discuss the history of money in general and what Bitcoin’s role in the history of money might be. Alongside Cathie and Art, we are also pleased to welcome Ophelia Snyder, the Co-Founder and President of 21.co, a Cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Product (ETP) provider. In the discussion, Cathie, Art and Ophelia discuss the original idea of centralized money, the economic booms and busts of the past, the transparency of digital assets and much more.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n- The United States early definition of a dollar\n- The relatively novel concept of centralized money\n- A world before the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 1913, and how the Fed changed money\n- Economic booms and busts in history starting with The Great Depression\n- How the real economy has changed in the US and globally\n- What a new Gold-Standard in the world of Digital Assets look like\n- Art argues for the necessity of a price rule\n- Stable coins and some of their inherent challenges\n- Bitcoin’s similarities to Gold\n- The number of wallets that hold Bitcoin long term\n- The potentially changing role of the SEC\n- Why a more transparent and decentralized ecosystem may be beneficial\n\n\nPlease note that 21.co and ARK are unaffiliated entities.\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://arkinv.st/ARKInvest\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "title": "The Consequences of Taxes with Dr. Art Laffer",
      "description": "According to Dr. Arthur Laffer, since 1913, when the United States first imposed the income tax via constitutional amendment, the top rate of that tax has determined the fate of the American economy. When the top rate has been high, as in the late 1910s, the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and 1970s, the response of those with money and capital has been to curtail real economic activity in favor of protecting assets and income streams. Huge declines have come to the economy in these circumstances. \n\nOn today’s podcast, ARK CEO, CIO and Founder Cathie Wood is again joined by Dr. Arthur Laffer, a famed economist, well-known for his creation of “The Laffer Curve,” so Dr. Laffer and Cathie can discuss Laffer’s book, Taxes Have Consequences, in which Dr. Laffer provides a history of taxes and their impact on the United States economy. Dr. Laffer explains why he believes that a low rate broad-based flat tax, spending restraint, sound money, minimal regulations, and free trade are the answers to most of our economic problems. \n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n- An overview of Arthur Laffer’s new book, Taxes Have Consequences. \n- How the government finances taxation.\n- A history of income tax since 1913.\n- Defining characteristics of the Roaring Twenties. \n- The market collapse that occurred in 1929.\n- Similarities between the environment in 1929 and today.\n- How Art would structure the American tax system if he could.\n- Why stimulus spending hurts the economy.\n- Art’s thoughts on regulation.\n- Why Art is a strong proponent of developing free trade agreements with countries that the US currently has issues with.\n- What makes America different from the rest of the world.\n- The correlation between tax hikes and economic performance.\n- Why everyone benefits in a low rate broad-based flat tax system.\n- The role of taxes in the Great Depression. \n- Factors that Art attributes the high inflation levels to.\n- The importance of acting fast when it comes to changing policies around taxes.\n- How the pandemic has accelerated the migration to low tax states.\n- Interesting statistics about states like Texas, Florida and Tennessee.\n- Art’s thoughts on how to address poverty in the United States.\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://arkinv.st/ARKInvest\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "description": "Scaling laws are as important to artificial intelligence (AI) as the law of gravity is in the world around us. AI is the empirical science of this decade, and Cerebras is a company dedicated to turning state-of-the-art research on large language models (LLMs) into open-source data that can be reproduced by developers across the world. In this episode, James Wang, an ARK alum and product marketing specialist at Cerebras, joins us for a discussion centered around the past and the future of LLM development and why the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) innovation taking place in this field is like nothing that has ever come before it (and has seemingly limitless possibilities). He also explains the motivation behind Cerebras’ unique approach and the benefits that their architecture and models are providing to developers.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n- Why Cerebras attracted James.\n- James explains the concept of wafer-scale computing and why it is so advantageous in the AI space.\n- A historical overview of large language model (LLM) development.\n•- What James believes to be the most significant natural law that has been discovered in this century.\n•- Why Cerebras wants to get state-of-the-art LLM data into the hands of as many people as possible.\n- The Cerebras GPT law.\n- Looking towards the future of LLMs.\n- Standard practice when it comes to training an LLM (and the problems that developers have been battling for years).\n- The potential advantage of Cerebras CS2 chips and computers. \n- Understanding the concept of disaggregated architecture.\n- How the Cerebras approach differs from the approach taken by other companies (NVIDIA and Dojo, for example).\n- Cerebras offerings that are available to be used by the public.\n- The current GPU cloud shortage (and why this adds to the appeal of Cerebras software).\n- Why the progress being made in the GPT space is incomparable to developments that have come before it. \n- Potential directions that the world could be heading in as a result of AI developments (and why James is optimistic about it all).\n- The AI use case that is keeping James up at night.\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

Ren and Brett discuss the potential size of the disruptive innovation opportunity, why ARK focuses exclusively on investing in innovation and what some of the major breakthroughs were in 2022 that the market might have missed while focusing closely on macroeconomic headwinds like interest rates and inflation. Ren explains why investors shouldn’t think of volatility negatively, and Brett answers the question: “Why should investors hold innovation strategies through downturns in the market?”\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n- Everything Brett’s role entails as Chief Futurist as ARK\n- What the size and scale might be for the disruptive innovation opportunity\n- Why ARK focuses exclusively on investing in disruptive innovation\n- Why Brett believes ChatGPT was a major breakthrough\n- Some of the major breakthroughs the market might have missed in 2022\n- Our belief that the market might be too focused on macroeconomic headwinds\n- What Brett would tell investors concerned about the inherent volatility in innovation\n- Making the case for an allocation to disruptive innovation in an investor’s portfolio\n- Why the broad-based benchmarks might be short innovation\n- The importance of maintain a long-term investment time horizon when investing in innovation\n- What innovation is happening in the private equity markets\n- Why ARK never changes its investment philosophy even in market turmoil\n- Answering the question: “Why should investors hold innovation strategies through downturns in the equity markets?”\n- Why investors should not try to “time” the market\n- Ren explains why volatility should not be considered a bad word\n- Companies seem to be holding elevated levels of cash on their balance sheets\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94More FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/",

These tools are improving the productivity of knowledge workers—~2x in the case of AI coding assistants.\n\nAI training cost declines continued at an annual rate of 70%, the cost to train a large language model to GPT-3 level performance collapsing from $4.6 million in 2020 to $450,000 in 2022. We expect cost declines to continue at a 70% rate through 2030. \n\nAI should increase the productivity of knowledge workers more than 4-fold by 2030. At 100% adoption, AI could increase global labor productivity ~$200 trillion, dwarfing the ~$32 trillion in total knowledge worker salaries. Listen in as Frank Downing, ARK Director of Research: Next Generation Internet, and William Summerlin, ARK Analyst & Co-Lead, ARK Venture, explain more.\n\nTo enlighten investors on the long-term impact of innovation, we began publishing Big Ideas in 2017. This annual research report seeks to highlight the technological breakthroughs evolving today and creating the potential for super-exponential growth tomorrow.\n\nWe believe that innovation is taking off now, corroborating our original research and boosting our confidence that ARK’s strategies are on the right side of change.

      "description": "ARK Client Portfolio Manager Ren Leggi and Chief Futurist Brett Winton discuss why ARK believes investors should consider an allocation to disruptive innovation in 2023 in today’s episode of FYI. Ren and Brett discuss the potential size of the disruptive innovation opportunity, why ARK focuses exclusively on investing in innovation and what some of the major breakthroughs were in 2022 that the market might have missed while focusing closely on macroeconomic headwinds like interest rates and inflation. Ren explains why investors shouldn’t think of volatility negatively, and Brett answers the question: “Why should investors hold innovation strategies through downturns in the market?”\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n- Everything Brett’s role entails as Chief Futurist as ARK\n- What the size and scale might be for the disruptive innovation opportunity\n- Why ARK focuses exclusively on investing in disruptive innovation\n- Why Brett believes ChatGPT was a major breakthrough\n- Some of the major breakthroughs the market might have missed in 2022\n- Our belief that the market might be too focused on macroeconomic headwinds\n- What Brett would tell investors concerned about the inherent volatility in innovation\n- Making the case for an allocation to disruptive innovation in an investor’s portfolio\n- Why the broad-based benchmarks might be short innovation\n- The importance of maintain a long-term investment time horizon when investing in innovation\n- What innovation is happening in the private equity markets\n- Why ARK never changes its investment philosophy even in market turmoil\n- Answering the question: “Why should investors hold innovation strategies through downturns in the equity markets?”\n- Why investors should not try to “time” the market\n- Ren explains why volatility should not be considered a bad word\n- Companies seem to be holding elevated levels of cash on their balance sheets\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94More FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/",

      "description": "With steadily increasing technological advancements and a new way of living with the global pandemic, Data as a service (DaaS) has become a very attractive business model. Taking full advantage of the growing internet is today’s guest, CEO of privately held SafeGraph and the host of The World of DaaS podcast, Auren Hoffman. To paraphrase our guest, SafeGraph sells data about physical places, they sell a collection of facts. Auren’s background as a software engineer launched him into the world of tech, and he explains why he believes DaaS is so important in today’s world. We learn that SafeGraph prioritizes data over analytics, why trading datamay be / appears to be better for business than selling it, and why value and accuracy could be / he believes, etc more important than data quantity. Software tools are leading to both market concentration and fragmentation, and we see how software’s evolution to be more text-prompt-based can be great for the everyday consumer. Auren is also an angel investor and he tells us what he prefers investing in and why he finds the current market so fascinating. Before discussing the slippery slope of universal standards, our guest shares why podcasting brings him joy and why being able to switch between platforms and systems is becoming a major selling point.

      "description": "The world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is a rapidly evolving sector that has grown tremendously in popularity in recent years. However, the original philosophy of crypto and blockchain has been altered by interests in capital gain and convenience, eroding the founding ethos of the technology. This was not acceptable to today’s guests, Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, who decided to build a blockchain technology that ensured the original spirit of the technology was preserved. Arthur and Kathleen are the creators of Tezos, a public blockchain that enables decentralized governance by allowing self-amendments. In today’s conversation, we dive into the underlying Tezos protocol and discover the various ways people are applying it. We learn what a rollup is, the different versions of rollups, and what data availability is as a concept. Hear about their approach to scaling, how scaling has changed from a research to an engineering problem, and why the Breitman’s believe gaming will catalyze the next wave of users of blockchain technology.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n- Background about our guests and what got them interested in crypto.\n- The motivation for Arthur and Kathleen to build their own blockchain.\n- How the narrative around cryptocurrencies has evolved and where Tezos fits in. \n- How Arthur and Kathleen formed the idea of on-chain governance as a middle ground.\n- An outline of the upsides and downsides to the on-chain governance approach.\n- The shift in motivation and ethos of the average crypto-user.\n- Past updates and the current state of the network.\n- Whether scaling is achieved by upgrading the core or Layer 2.\n- What data availability is as a concept and why it is essential. \n- A breakdown of a rollup and the various approaches to scaling.\n- What rollup approach the Tezos network uses to scale. \n- The many ways people are using the Tezos network. \n- How Arthur and Kathleen measure the growth and use of the Tezos network.\n- What they think will cause more people to adopt the network in the future.\n- Why venture capitalists have become interested in cryptocurrencies. \n- Comparing the railroads of the 1900s with public blockchains that exist today.\n- Ways in which capitalization of crypto and blockchain technology will be overcome.\n- An outline of the future for Tezos and how the community is involved. \n- Arthur and Kathleen’s take on the regulatory environment and how it’ll change in the future.\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94More FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/",

      "description": "Please note: as of 3/31/22, ARK’s clients own greater than 1% of the shares outstanding of Velo3D.\n\nARK expects 3D printing to revolutionize manufacturing by collapsing the time between design and production, reducing costs, and providing greater design complexity, accuracy and customization. We believe 3D printing can enable digital inventory and distributed manufacturing, adding flexibility to supply chains. On today’s episode, ARK Research Analyst Tasha Keeney and Research Associate Pierce Jamieson interview Benny Buller, founder and CEO of Velo3D, a leader in end-to-end 3D printing space. Benny observed the additive manufacturing (AM) industry with fresh eyes and no prior manufacturing experience. In doing so, he observed a fundamental flaw limiting the speed of AM adoption: Engineers not only had to learn a new manufacturing process (AM), but they also had to learn a new design process (DfAM). He built Velo3D from the ground up, solving for this root challenge, enabling design to inform manufacturing not the other way around.\n\nKey Points in this Episode:\n- The origin story of 3D Printing and why Benny started Velo3D.\n- What determines a part’s usability with internal supports.\n- What software Velo3D uses in the manufacturing process.\n- The current repeatability of 3D printing and the overall importance of repeatability.\n- The design process for additive manufacturing.\n- Design freedom that 3D printing allows when manufacturing parts.\n- What is driving growth in the additive manufacturing industry today.\n- The future of material science and 3D printing.\n- How machine learning and advanced optimization is affecting 3D printing.\n- How 3D printing is driving the future of innovation.\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94More FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/",

      "title": "The Future of Robotics as a Service with Saman Farid of Formic",
      "description": "Saman Farid believes that robots are a means to an end and while their importance is derived from the output they create, many companies are focused solely on the hardware itself. In this episode, we are joined by - Saman Farid, the CEO of Formic which is a privately held Robotics as a Service (RaaS) company that focuses on the output rather than the hardware. He sheds light on the concept of Robotics as a Service and what this really means. On today’s episode, you’ll hear about the barriers to robot adoption in manufacturing, the development of technologies that make it possible to use industrial robots in a collaborative way, the challenges of implementation in this field, and how the declining costs of hardware are opening up more opportunities in this sector. You’ll also learn more about why Saman believes that in the future, companies will either be building new robots, or operating them and generating value from them, but not both. To hear what excites Saman the most about the advancement of robotics in the next five years and why he believes that robots are not stealing jobs but creating more, listen now!\n\nKey Points from this Episode\n- Saman Farid’s thoughts on the concept of Robotics as a Service and what this really means.\n- Thoughts on how innovative technologies tend to take hold during tumultuous times and how the pandemic is driving adoption.\n- The labor shortage and supply chain challenges and how Formic is trying to formulate ideas to address these issues.\n- The barriers to robot adoption in manufacturing.\n- The types of tasks that Formic has had the most success in automating and those that still need work.\n- The dynamic Saman sees in the use of collaborative robots versus more traditional caged-off industrial robots.\n- The development of technologies that make it possible to use industrial robots in a collaborative way.\n- The challenges of implementation and training in the development of this field.\n- Business alignment challenges between companies that build robots and those that do Robotics as a Service.\n- Saman’s prediction that the differentiation between the hardware vendors of robots is decreasing and specialization is increasing.\n- Thoughts on the declining costs for the hardware of robotics and the opportunities that this opens up in manufacturing.\n- Saman’s answer to the common question “Are robots stealing and destroying jobs?”\n- What excites him the most about the advancement of robotics in the next five years.\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "description": "Please note: as of 12/31/21, ARK’s clients own greater than 1% of the shares outstanding of Verve Therapeutics.\n\nOn this episode of FYI, ARK Analyst Ali Urman is joined by Verve Therapeutics CEO Sek Kathiresan and Chief Scientific Officer Andrew Bellinger. Verve, a biotechnology company, was created with the sole focus of protecting the world from heart disease. For many years, institutions have approached cardiovascular disease with a chronic care model, prescribing medications to help reduce symptoms and complications, such as heart attack and high blood pressure. Verve Therapeutics wants to change that model. Founded in 2018, Verve was created with the idea that we can develop a one-and-done gene-editing medicine to permanently lower LDL cholesterol to treat heart attack, the world’s leading cause of death.\n\nIn today’s episode, Dr. Kathiresan and Dr. Bellinger weigh in on the development of gene-editing and its impacts on cardiovascular disease. They discuss gene-editing costs, the importance of lowering LDL cholesterol levels, importance of liver delivery, their PCSK9 program, and why it could be revolutionary for the future of cardiovascular health. For the past four years, Verve has worked to develop proof of concept in monkeys specifically. Gene-editing therapies, such as Verves, could help create longer term health for patients. Listen in to learn more!\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n• An introduction to Verve Therapeutics  \n• Dr. Kathiresan’s inspiration for treating cardiovascular disease \n• Issues with the chronic care model \n• Development of PCSK9\n• Overcoming the unmet need of the LDL care \n• Thinking about healthcare from the upstream approach \n• How COVID vaccines have shown feasibility in development \n• How the pipeline continues emerging \n• Challenges of nanoparticles being picked up by the liver \n• Developing a new therapy with homozygous monkey model \n• Difference between healthy vs. heterozygous patients \n• How costs affect the work and role of COVID MRNA\n• Off-target editing \n• What we need to get to market quicker \n• Engaging with Twitter to advance the conversation \n• Data visualization\n\nTweetables:\n\n“When people think about gene-editing they are immediately thinking rare disease pricing and millions of dollars per dose … that’s not going to be our model because we ultimately want to reach millions of patients” – @skathire\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "description": "Here at ARK, innovation is the name of the game when it comes to our investment strategies, but this is not a very common approach when you look at the larger swathes of investors. On today’s show, ARK Client Portfolio Specialist Dan White sits down with Ren Leggi, ARK Client Portfolio Manager to talk about his recent blog post, titled ‘The Equity Market Cap Associated with Technologically Enabled Innovation Is Likely to Grow Exponentially.‘ Ren provides insight into what the research shows about the potential of innovation-based stocks, and why the growth we have seen in the innovation sector during the last year is likely to keep scaling at an increasing rate. We also talk about what this means for a post-pandemic world, discuss the areas of focus for ARK when it comes to innovative technologies, and how these investments can influence the volatility of a portfolio. Ren makes a strong argument for why backing innovation is not only a good idea but dangerous to ignore, so to hear it all from Ren and Dan, listen in today!\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n• A little of Ren's background and work before joining the team at ARK. \n• Adoption acceleration during the era of the pandemic. \n• ARK's approach to the different avenues of innovation; listing the five platforms. \n• The huge spike in market cap across the five platforms that has occurred over the last year. \n• Assessing the size of this market cap and the projected growth in the near future.\n• How the technologies on the vanguard are helping push each other forward. \n• Tools for measuring and tracking growth and liquidity in the innovation space.\n• Situating this conversation globally and how competition is popping up outside of the US.\n• Possible capacity, thoughts on volatility, and rethinking how to trade innovation stocks. \n• Finding a place for innovative technology within a portfolio of more traditional asset classes. \n• The biggest risk associated with investment right now: under-allocation to innovation! \n\nTweetables:\n\n“People are not to go back to these old ways, especially if it is cheaper, faster, and more efficient.” — Ren Leggi\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "title": "The CRISPR Revolution and the New Era of Genome Editing with Kevin Davies",
      "description": "Kevin Davies is a renowned British science journalist and the executive editor of The CRISPR Journal, based in New York. His literary career began with Breakthrough: The Race to Find the Breast Cancer Gene in the early 1990s, followed by Cracking the Genome, which details the dramatic story of one of the greatest scientific feats ever accomplished: the mapping of the human genome. His other titles include the $1,000 Genome, DNA: The Story of the Genetic Revolution, and his most recent release, Editing Humanity: The CRISPR Revolution and the New Era of Genome Editing, for which he won a Guggenheim Fellowship for science writing in 2017. Kevin studied at Oxford University and moved to the US in 1987 after earning his Ph.D. in genetics. He is the founding editor of the Nature Genetics journal and Bio-IT World magazine, former editor-in-chief of Cell Press, and the first publisher of C&EN, the weekly magazine of the American Chemical Society. In today’s episode, Kevin elaborates on his career trajectory and explains why he believes that hanging up his lab coat was the best decision he ever made. We also touch on the common themes that run through his books, some of the challenges scientific publishers and editors face, and the importance of promoting the work of women scientists. We also cover vectors, CRISPR babies, the cost of gene therapy, and so much more! Make sure not to miss this fascinating discussion with the remarkable Kevin Davies.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n• Kevin’s career trajectory and his so-called “desperate” shift to science journalism.\n• How Kevin believes the field of genetics has evolved since he was a geneticist in the 1980s.\n• Learn about the impetus behind the Nature Genetics journal and The CRISPR Journal.\n• What motivated Kevin to write Breakthrough, including a meeting with Mary-Claire King.\n• Three elements in all of his books: genetics, medical or societal impact, and personal drama.\n• Hanging up his lab coat to join Nature and the access to authors that it afforded him.\n• Kevin reflects on the demographic representation and “race to the finish line” issues in scientific publishing and the burden editors face.\n• The lens through which Nobel Prizes are considered and how it can shift perspectives.\n• The importance of promoting women in science, who have traditionally been overlooked.\n• How Kevin’s book, Editing Humanity, coincided with Doudna and Charpentier making history as the first two women to share a Nobel Prize.\n• Stanley Qi’s role in the CRISPR story, which Kevin calls an “unsung contribution.”\n• Speculation and trepidation surrounding vectors: Kevin shares some new thinking.\n• Germline genome editing, CRISPR babies, He Jiankui, and controversy in Hong Kong.\n• Learn more about the exponential cost of gene therapies and gene editing drugs.\n\nTweetables:\n\n“How we turn this stunning 21st-century medicine into therapies that are affordable is going to be a Nobel Prize-winning discovery if anybody can crack that one.\" — @KevinADavies\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "description": "Today, 20 years after we sequenced the first human genome, we’re starting to see the fruits of genomics. Instead of treating symptoms, researchers are focused on finding cures for once chronic and fatal diseases. We’re starting to reimagine medicine in ways previously thought impossible. This week on the For Your Innovation Podcast, we’re joined by Dr. Samarth Kulkarni, Chief Executive Officer of CRISPR Therapeutics. Sam joined CRISPR in early 2015 as Chief Business Officer. Two years later, in 2017, he was appointed to CEO. In addition to his expertise in biotech strategy and operations, Sam has spearheaded initiatives in personalized medicine, immunotherapy, and other therapeutic technologies. In today’s episode, we’re also joined by ARK’s CEO/ CIO, Cathie Wood, who helps provides her insights on macrotrends currently affecting the biotech industry as we come out of last week’s J.P. Morgan Health Care conference. Tune in to hear more on costs of genomic therapies, AI integration, and why Sam believes the “roaring twenties” of biotech may be on the horizon.\n\nKey Points From This Episode: \n\n• Why today is an exciting time for biotech\n• Why Cathie believes macro factors, such as fears of inflation and valuations, are determining the present course of genomics companies \n• Innovations and Improvements emerging in the biomedical innovation space\n• The importance of former iterations of patented CRISPR-Cas9 for future treatments\n• Will the timeline for advancing drugs to market shrink with time?\n• Potential gene-editing developments in the near future - including the balance of ex vivo and in vivo\n• The possibilities of what it will take to expand human life, while also treating rare diseases\n• Sam on why having a capital base for sustainable funding could lead to better long term effects\n• Moonshot Ideas and the next 10 years\n\nTweetables: \n\n“Every pharma company will have to have a cell gene therapy unit otherwise you risk being left behind” - @CrisprSam \n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "title": "The Evolving World of RNA Editing with Dr. David Nelles",
      "description": "Up until recently, DNA has dominated the field of technological development. However, RNA is slowly but surely finding its place on the stage. Although it is more fragile, and therefore more difficult to handle, there are a multitude of benefits to working with RNA over DNA, and in today’s episode we are joined by Dr. David Nelles, who is going to open your mind to the power that lies within these special molecules. David has spent the majority of his career building technologies that recognize and change RNA in human cells, and as you’ll hear today, there are numerous benefits to the development of this kind of technology. In our discussion, we talk about how CRISPR is evolving and why it has taken over from other gene editing techniques, the differences between homology directed repair (HDR) and non homologous end joining (NHEJ), and some of the things that David is most excited about in the future of the incredibly diverse and fascinating RNA field. \n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n● Factors that caused CRISPR to dominate the gene editing space. \n● David explains the difference between DNA and RNA, using a football analogy.\n● The goal that David centered his PhD around.\n● Variety that exists amongst RND molecules. \n● Benefits of targeting RNA in diseased cells, rather than DNA.\n● Why RNA lagged behind DNA in terms of technological developments. \n● A theory about the role played by RNA in the past. \n● Methods of RNA editing.\n● Comparing homology directed repair (HDR) and non homologous end joining (NHEJ).\n● David provides a breakdown of the various different guides and enzymes. \n● Three kinds of vector systems, and how they work.\n● Examples of the types of RNAs that exist.\n● What David is excited about in the future of the RNA technology field.\n\n\nTweetables:\n\n“DNA is the same throughout your body. Whereas, RNA is distinct among different cell types, among different tissues, among healthy versus diseased cells from moment to moment, whether you’re sleeping or whether you’re awake.”— @DeeNelles [0:06:43]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY\nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU\nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO\n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "description": "Despite the millions of creators who are cumulatively making billions of dollars a year, and the infinite potential of this creator economy, in our view the field is still not taken seriously enough by investors, social media platforms, or financial institutions. Sima Gandhi, co-founder of Creative Juice, is on a mission to change this, by giving creators the knowledge and the tools to reach their full potential. Whether you are just starting out in the space, or you’ve dedicated yourself to your creative business full time, Creative Juice offers their innovative approach to banking, their investment fund, and their soon-to-be-released cash flow management program. FinTech and the creator economy have evolved in a multitude of ways over the years, mainly as a result of three major trends which we discuss today. Creative Juice seeks to facilitate the next phase of this evolution and, along with Sima, we are very excited to see what the future holds! \n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n● What Sima’s career journey has looked like.\n● The passion which drove Sima to co-found Creative Juice.\n● Sima explains Creative Juice’s main goal, and the first product they launched to help them achieve this. \n● Evergreen metrics; what these are and why creators need to understand them.\n● Why Creative Juice has opened a bank.\n● Common financial struggles experienced by creators. \n● A difference between money management in the creator space, compared to other fields.\n● The infinite potential that Sima sees in the creator economy.\n● Three big technological trends that have helped to facilitate the creator economy.\n● Platforms that are most commonly used by creators.\n● FinTech’s evolution, and where Creative Juice sits within this. \n● How Sima thinks the creator economy is going to grow in the future.\n● Sima explains the different tiers within the creator economy.\n● Ways that social media platforms can assist creators, and why they should.\n● The problem with investors’ approach to creators, and how Creative Juice is changing this.\n● Sima and her son’s favorite types of creator content.\n● What Sima is excited about in Creative Juice’s future. \n\nTweetables:\n\n“I think the creator economy is going to ultimately be the distribution for almost all of the traditional things that you would consider economy.” —  @simagoo [0:10:20]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/​​​​\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/​​​​​​ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY​​​​​​ \nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX​​​​​​\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU​​​​​​ \nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO​​​​​​ \n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94​​​​​​",

      "title": "Invisible Technologies with Francis Pedraza",
      "description": "Today, ARK is joined by a person who isn’t afraid to do things differently, Francis Pedraza, the CEO of Invisible Technologies. In Francis’ own words, “Invisible is ops as a service,” and the idea for the private company was sparked by his realization about why everything isn’t yet automated, even though there’s an automation tool for everything. The way Invisible funds their operation is just as unique in the technology startup world as is their way of operating. Over the course of this podcast episode, Francis shares his vision. As with most great founding stories, there were some bumps in the road along his journey, but when you hear about the success that Invisible has experienced you will see the value in taking the road less travelled!\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n• Francis explains what his company, Invisible Technologies does.\n• Two major waves of outsourcing that have occurred since the 1990’s.\n• Why most products aren’t built to be backward compatible.\n• Three major challenges that Invisible ran into when looking for investors.\n• How Invisible ended up with such a broad range of use cases. \n• The company that Francis started prior to Invisible, and why it didn’t work.\n• Frictional costs that exist between supply and demand.\n• What Invisible’s business model looked like at first, and how it changed over time.\n• Why Invisible is not threatened by automation players in their space.\n• How Invisible fared during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n• Factors that are driving the growth Invisible has experienced in 2021.\n• How Francis is going to ensure that Invisible is always owned by the people who are building it, and why he is so determined to achieve this. \n• Hear Francis’ take on being a contrarian.\n\nTweetables:\n\n“Invisible is ops as a service. We make it really easy to delegate any business process that you have at your company, whether it's something you're doing, or your team is doing, or it's a business-critical company-wide workflow.” — Francis Pedraza\n\n“The irony of paying the contrarian tax for so many years is that, by swimming upstream, you get to the other end, and there are no competitors.” — Francis Pedraza\n\n\nLinks Mentioned:\nInvisible Technologies\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/​​​​\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/​​​​​​ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY​​​​​​ \nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX​​​​​​\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU​​​​​​ \nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO​​​​​​ \n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94​​​​​​",

      "title": "NFTs with Witek Radomski and Caleb Applegate of Enjin",
      "description": "In March of 2021, the phrase NFT or Non-Fungible Token dominated the mainstream media when a 69 million dollar jpg was sold to the highest bidder. Our guests today are key figures in a company that has been utilizing this technology for years across multiple sectors. We are joined by CTO, Witek Radomski, and COO, Caleb Applegate of Enjin, an emerging NFT company. Enjin has operated within the gaming space for the past 12 years, and in 2017 broadened its focus to include the construction of an NFT ecosystem. Their goal is to build a comprehensive and scalable ecosystem that meets the demands of, not only the modern gaming industry but also multiple use cases beyond that. In our conversation with Witek and Caleb, we discuss the formation of Enjin and how it first recognized the potential for blockchain technology in the gaming sector. Witek unpacks their focus on the gaming sector and explains why they were dedicated to creating a metaverse across games and gaming platforms where users could transfer their assets. Tuning in you’ll hear the finer details of how NFTs function in the gaming sector and other use cases as well as Enjin’s approach to scalability with regards to NFTs and some of the programs they’ve launched to support that. Witek and Caleb share examples of work they’ve done with clients like Microsoft and Samsung and reflect on their hopes and expectations for the future of NFT technology and its application for the average user.

They would basically take donations from players in order to get perks in the game.” — @witekradomski [0:04:56]\n\n“The game developers haven’t really been flexible, especially when, if you’re not a top-tier company that can provide APIs for people to feed into, it’s really a walled garden and it’s hard for people to want to create a community and do that.” — @witekradomski [0:09:56]\n\n“I think what I’m excited about is just education for the masses. We still have a lot of people who don’t really understand what a non-fungible token is and its practical application across any kind of industry really.” — @calebapplegate [0:34:41]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/​​​​\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/​​​​​​ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY​​​​​​ \nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX​​​​​​\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU​​​​​​ \nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO​​​​​​ \n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94​​​​​​",

      "description": "Over the past five to 10 years, development in the field of human gene editing has advanced at an unprecedented speed. We are now living in an age where therapeutic human gene editing is already a reality for some of us. Today we are joined by Dr. David Liu to discuss these exciting developments. Dr. Liu is a Richard Merkin Professor, Director of the Merkin Institute of Transformative Technologies and Healthcare, Vice-Chair of the Faculty at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, and the Co-founder or Founder of nine biotech or therapeutics companies. He's published over 195 scientific papers and is the inventor of over 75 issued patents. Today he introduces us to the three main forms of modern genome editing, how they work, their benefits, and their limitations. He explains how the development of CRISPR had an enormous impact on the reach and scope of this field and describes some of the massive developments achieved by his labs in base editing and prime editing. Tune in today to hear how these different types of modalities might be best suited for different types of therapeutic interventions and Dr. Liu’s thoughts on whether or not one method will replace another. Find out if either of these technologies is more amenable to addressing polygenic diseases, the roles and complications of viral and non-viral delivery vectors, and how Dr. Liu believes these technologies will extend in the future. For all this and more, tune in today!\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n- Dr. David Liu’s background and some of his impressive credentials. \n- An introduction to gene editing and how Dr. Liu became interested in it. \n- The groundbreaking development made by Peter Dervan and how this influenced the field. \n- Dr. Liu’s Unifactor 2000 project to develop a series of RNA molecules that could target any site in the genome and why it failed. \n- An introduction to the three main forms of modern genome editing.\n- What zinc fingers are and how they can be used to bind a DNA sequence of one's choosing. \n- What tail nucleases are and how tail proteins can bind a DNA sequence of one's choosing. \n- The breakthrough that came with the CRISPR system and how it initiated this modern gene-editing renaissance. \n- How the ease and accessibility of CRISPR has had an enormous impact on the reach and the scope of these developments. \n- What base editing and prime editing are and how they work together. \n- Some of the outcomes that can occur when you cut the DNA in a chromosome. \n- The two realizations that motivated Dr. Liu’s lab’s developments of base editing and prime editing. \n- Dr. Liu explains in detail how base editors and prime editors change DNA.  \n- How Dr. Liu and his lab took the development of the CRISPR approach to develop these new techniques and how this was influenced by Homology Directed Repair.\n- What different types of modalities may be best suited for different types of therapeutic interventions. \n- Why one would pursue a CRISPR double-stranded break-based method versus doing base editing or prime editing. \n- How the companies Prime Medicine and Beam that have licensed these methods work together in the best interests of the patient. \n- Dr. Liu’s thoughts on whether or not prime editing is going to replace base editing.\n- Insight into the need for PAM sequences in Cas9 and the advantage of prime editing as it does not need a specific PAM sequence.\n- How Dr. Liu believes these technologies will extend in the future.\n- Thoughts on whether or not one flavor of these technologies is more amenable to addressing polygenic diseases. \n- What a delivery vehicle is, the differences between viral and non-viral vehicles, and the complications of using viral delivery vectors. \n- Concerns with regard to immunogenicity and immune reaction from an LMP and how this relates to the COVID vaccine.\n\nTweetables:\n\n“There are already humans walking this earth that have had their genomes modified, specifically in a way to counteract a genetic disease. That's really a pretty momentous era in the history of man.” — @davidrliu [0:10:37]\n\n“The motivation behind base editing was the simple recognition that for most genetic diseases, to study the disease or to treat the disease, we can't really do that well if we just mess up the gene. We need to actually precisely fix it.” — @davidrliu [0:13:10]\n\n“I think that's one of the potential downsides of viral delivery is that whenever you're introducing new DNA into a cell, you have to be very careful to minimize the possibility that the DNA gets in and initiates cancer.” — @davidrliu [0:56:33]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/​​​​\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/​​​​​​ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY​​​​​​ \nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX​​​​​​\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU​​​​​​ \nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO​​​​​​ \n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94​​​​​​",

      "title": "Cross-Border Payment Disruption with Ham Serunjogi",
      "description": "Before the launch of M-Pesa, a Kenyan-founded mobile-phone money transfer service, sending money in much of Africa required trips to the bank. However, since then, mobile money transfers have exploded across the continent. Despite this, fees associated with cross-border payments are notoriously expensive, ranging between 10-20%. Chipper Cash is looking to disrupt this space, with fees of only 5%, and they are only just getting started. The Co-Founder of this startup, Ham Serunjogi, is today’s guest, and as someone who grew up in Uganda, he has a unique perspective on what this kind of solution means for the continent. \n\nIn this episode, Ham sheds light on the company and why he and Maijid Moujaled felt drawn to building the platform. Having both been educated in the U.S., they saw just how simple sending money could be, and they knew the African fintech space was ready for Chipper when they launched in 2018. We hear about how the company manages to keep their fees low, where they have invested their money, and why they believe that competition is so important in the space. We also touch on the pandemic, which accelerated the company’s growth, and why this time has only reinforced Chipper's mission of providing a reliable, efficient product to its users.  \n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n- What Chipper Cash does and the impetus for founding the company. \n- How Ham and his co-founder, Maijid Moujaled, met and started working together. \n- The difficulties Ham and Maijid faced in trying to get Chipper off the ground. \n- Some of Chipper Cash’s numbers: user base, funds raised, and employees. \n- The role of timing in a company’s success, particularly in Africa’s fragmented fintech landscape. \n- Developments and investments that illustrate the big shifts in African fintech. \n- The history of mobile money payments in Africa and what changed the game completely. \n- Why cross-border transfer fees are so expensive in Africa and how Chipper has managed their low price point. \n- The cross-border money sending ecosystem in Africa can accommodate so many players. \n- How Chipper decides on its product rollouts and what else the company has in store. \n- The crypto product Chipper currently offers and where Ham sees this going in Africa. \n\nTweetables:\n\n“Chipper’s success is not going to be a function of others failing. It’s actually going to be a function of others succeeding. This is a very large space.” — @HSerunjogi [0:30:33]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/​​​​\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/​​​​​​ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY​​​​​​ \nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX​​​​​​\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU​​​​​​ \nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO​​​​​​ \n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94​​​​​​",

      "title": "The State of Robotaxis in China with Prof. X",
      "description": "The development of self-driving cars and assisted-driving cars has taken massive strides in the last decade. In today’s episode, we speak with MIT and Princeton graduate, Dr. Jianxiong Xiao, also known as Professor X. Dr. Xiao founded AutoX in 2016, which became the first private company to commercialize fully autonomous robotaxis in China in 2020. Their self-driving vehicles have successfully been deployed throughout the Pingshan District, known as the downtown tech center of Shenzhen, where they have been made fully available to the public.\n\nToday, we speak with Dr. Xiao about his career, what AutoX has been able to accomplish since 2016, and what he has learned from developing self-driving cars. He explains how regulation has had to catch up with the technology of self-driving cars and how those regulations are set both internally and externally with regards to self-driving cars in California and China. We also discuss Dr. Xiao’s hopes and predictions for the global market of self-driving cars and how those will be affected by factors like pricing and demand. He explains that China’s demand for robotaxis is significantly informed by its cultural attitude to car ownership, as well as the government’s regulatory attitude towards pollution. Dr. Xiao breaks down some of the technology they use in AutoX and shares his opinion on HD mapping, and we also discuss the steady improvement of AI technology and how it adapts to traffic and predicts movement. Dr. Xiao is confident that the cost of self-driving cars and robotaxis will continue to go down and become more accessible over time so, for all this and more, join us for an exciting and informative conversation!\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n• Introducing Jianxiong Xiao, also known as Professor X, who founded AutoX in 2016.\n• Dr. Xiao’s education, from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology to MIT.\n• How AutoX became the first company to commercialize fully autonomous cars in China.\n• The challenge of creating fully autonomous self-driving cars that do not need a driver at all.\n• How regulations in China had to catch up with the technology of these cars and insurance.\n• Dr. Xiao goes into detail regarding the safety regulations\n• The different aspects of Waymo and LIDAR when it comes to designing self-driving cars and how they converge to ensure optimum safety.\n• A discussion on the limitations of cameras in self-driving car design.\n• How radars and cameras complement one another in 3D mapping.\n• Why Dr. Xiao is confident the cost of self-driving cars will continue to decrease.\n• The steady improvement of AI technology, how it adapts to traffic, and predicts movement.\n• The crucial role that multiple engineers play in improving AI for self-driving cars.\n• Why Shenzhen’s high population density makes it a good city for gathering data.\n• The difficulty of collecting data on how moving objects like pedestrians and bicycles interact.\n• The learning, collaboration, and hard work needed to bring self-driving cars to fruition.\n• Dr. Xiao discusses the importance of HD mapping.\n• The challenges of keeping mapping up to date, especially in a city like Shenzhen, which has a very high development rate.\n• Variation in data policies in different countries and how it affects technological development.\n• The role of V2X in AutoX’s commercialization of self-driving cars.\n• Why Dr. Xiao believes public confusion between assisted-driving and fully self-driving cars is one of the biggest challenges facing the industry.\n• Why the regulation for assisted driving cars is more complicated than fully self-driving cars.\n\nTweetables:\n\n“With a lot of data [and] a lot of mileage, our systems are going to improve over time. You can expect the self-driving car to not just drive safer and safer, but also be more and more natural.” — @xjx [0:33:56]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/​​​​\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/​​​​​​ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY​​​​​​ \nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX​​​​​​\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU​​​​​​ \nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO​​​​​​ \n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94​​​​​​",

      "title": "The Future of Genome Editing with Professor David Liu",
      "description": "Today’s guest on the For Your Innovation Podcast is Professor David Liu, who will be sharing his expertise on the subject of genome editing, the ability to make highly specific changes in the DNA sequence of a living organism, essentially customizing its genetic makeup. David is a Richard Merkin Professor, Director of the Merkin Institute of Transformative Technologies in Healthcare, and Vice-Chair of the Faculty at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, as well as the scientific founder or cofounder of six biotechnology and therapeutics companies, including Editas, Exo Therapeutics, Beam Therapeutics, and Prime Medicine. He himself went to Harvard and graduated first in his class, and he has since published more than 195 scientific papers and is the inventor of 75+ issued U.S. patents.\n\nProfessor Liu’s research integrates chemistry and evolution to illuminate biology and enable next-generation therapeutics and, in this episode, he shares some of his insights into base editing and prime editing and their advantages when compared with CRISPR, specifically the advantages of precisely fixing rather than disrupting genes, which could be a life-saving solution for a huge number of genetic conditions. He also touches on the next frontier of proteome editing and explains the role that Botox plays, his surprising involvement in developing a system to beat Blackjack, and his predictions for the future of gene editing therapeutics, some of which might sound like science fiction! Tune in today to learn more.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n• David explains what base editing is: a strategy for changing the genome instead of cutting the DNA double helix.\n• Some advantages of base editing, including precisely fixing rather than disrupting a gene.\n• How prime editing factors into this, enabling all 12 possible base-to-base changes as opposed to the four of base editing.\n• Hear about the background of these discoveries and David’s involvement in developing them.\n• The relationship between Beam and Prime Medicine; how they leverage technologies and experience to bring prime editing to patients.\n• David touches on some of the potential applications of genome editing in agriculture.\n• David’s thoughts on how quickly costs for these therapeutics will decline, based on their stunning rate of progress.\n• Whether gene editing therapeutics could dominate or replace small molecule therapeutics.\n• DNA templated synthesis and DNA encoded chemistry and their synergy with gene editing.\n• How he divides his time and responsibilities between his lab and his various companies.\n• A fun fact about David: he taught a class on developing systems that could beat Blackjack!\n• Finally, hear David’s predictions for gene editing therapeutics over the next five to 10 years.\n\nTweetables:\n\n“For most human genetic diseases, you need to precisely fix a gene in order to have the anticipated therapeutic benefit, as opposed to disrupting the gene.” — @davidrliu \n\n“I care deeply about making our science transition from the pages of a journal to some societal benefit, whether it's more nutritious crops or new medicines for diseases that can't be treated otherwise.” — @davidrliu \n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/​​​​\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/​​​​​​ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY​​​​​​ \nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX​​​​​​\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU​​​​​​ \nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO​​​​​​ \n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94​​​​​​",

      "title": "Deep Dive into SPACs with Harry Sloan and Eli Baker",
      "description": "A SPAC, or Special Purpose Acquisition Company, is a company with no commercial operations and is formed strictly to raise capital through an IPO to acquire an existing company. Today’s guests are Harry Sloan and Eli Baker from Eagle Equity Partners which leads Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition company. Together Harry, Eli, and their partner Jeff Sagansky have done several SPACs with target companies such as Skillz and DraftKings and our conversation today is all about how SPACs work and some of their advantages and pitfalls. \n\nWe begin with a quick definition of a SPAC and how it differs from a regular way IPO. We then talk about a few of the advantages of taking companies public using SPACs and the kinds of companies that this deal structure works well for. Harry and Eli take listeners through a granular explanation of what a typical SPAC would look like and the different phases the process involves. Our conversation then turns to some of the problems being seen in the world of SPACs and perhaps the market more generally right now. We explore the idea of SPAC sponsors being ‘gig economy IPO bankers for investment banks’. We talk about the problem of too many SPAC sponsors raising too many deals which points to a potential bubble. Part of what SPACs involve are long-term projections for young companies but these can be untrustworthy and this is producing a situation that is being exacerbated by over-speculation and retail investing trends. Our conversation winds down on this note and our guests speak to whether this could be something that regulators can address. We end off on the question of whether SPACs are here to stay. Join us!\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n● Introducing Harry and Eli and how they got into doing SPACs.\n● A brief definition of a SPAC and how presents a different way of going public than an IPO.\n● Initial SPACs our guests worked on and why they chose the companies they did.\n● Advantages of using SPACs instead of regular way IPOs.\n● Why the observation that 70% of IPOs are SPACs now needs to be reframed.\n● A deep dive into the process of how SPACs work: IPOs via SPAC, the purpose of PIPE, etc.\n● How there is so much scarcity value attached to PIPEs and why this is causing a bubble.\n● Exploring the idea that ‘SPAC sponsors are gig economy IPO bankers for investment banks’.\n● Many SPAC sponsors raise too many deals unfortunately making things into an AUM game.\n● Why Harry and Eli are different from other players in the game by working harder for longer on each SPAC.\n● What goes into the extra work Harry and Eli put into SPACs regarding getting to know target companies.\n● Why the projections made by SPACs are often less trustworthy than those by more mature publicly traded companies.\n● Difficulties drawing the line of when is it too early to take a company public using a SPAC.\n● The problem of too much gambling or speculation in the stock market right now.\n● Another issue of people not voting to get deals done because of retail access to options.\n● Final perspectives on why the SPAC phenomenon feels speculative and retail-heavy.\n● Harry comments on the Churchill leak and why leaks are a problem for SPACs but not regular IPOs.\n● Problems about SPACs that the SEC should address; leaks and long-term projections.\n● Whether the amount of SPACs will continue to grow or hit a wall instead.\n● The problem of SPAC funds using leverage to increase their funds.\n\nTweetables:\n\n“It scares me that SPACs are being associated with pre-product, pre-revenue, pre-everything.” — Harry Sloan [0:41:19]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/​​​​\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/​​​​​​ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY​​​​​​ \nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX​​​​​​\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU​​​​​​ \nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO​​​​​​ \n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94​​​​​​",

      "title": "The Future of Oncology with Dr. Mark Lewis",
      "description": "At its root, oncology is about having empathetic and candid conversations that guide patients towards taking the best path of care. Having been diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumor early in his career, Dr. Mark Lewis has developed a clear perspective on cancer care that is informed by his experience as both a patient and as an oncologist. Today, we speak with Mark to gain an insight into the future of oncology and hear his view on the field as the Director of Gastrointestinal Oncology for the Intermountain Healthcare System. We open our conversation by exploring Mark’s background and how both he and his father’s cancer diagnoses have placed hereditary cancer syndromes on center stage. After chatting about how genetics can impact illness, he unpacks how the setting in which patients are diagnosed and treated impacts their understanding of their disease. Linked to this, we talk about the controversy surrounding genetic testing products before looking at the benefits of these tests. While reflecting on how quickly the medical field is evolving, we touch on how Mark keeps up with innovation, the problem of how both broad and specialized cancer treatment is, and how you can best judge the merit of new research. Later, we discuss the physical and psychological damage that can be caused by cancer screening, why Mark so strongly believes in screening for colon cancer, and the issue that oncologists are becoming too strained. We wrap up our informative discussion by hearing about the role of AI within oncology and the improvements that Mark hopes to see within the next decade. Tune in to hear Mark’s balanced take on the future of oncology. \n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n● Mark shares details about his background and family history with cancer.\n● The frictions within the medical community about how genetics influence illness.  \n● How direct-to-consumer genotyping products have traditionally under-delivered in value.\n● Reflecting on the importance of being honest with your patients.\n● What investors, patients, and practitioners can do to keep up with innovation.\n● Exploring the challenges of separating good research from bad research. \n● Weighing up the dangers of screening with its benefits. \n● The need for patient therapeutic support when performing diagnostic tests.\n● Hear why now is such a critical time in the development of imaging and testing. \n● Why early intervention is so important when treating cancer.\n● Bridging the gap between cutting edge research and actual medical practice.\n● Mark’s view that the future of medicine will be informed by genetics. \n● Unpacking the growing problems within the field of oncology.  \n● The role that AI plays within oncology.\n● What diagnostic improvements Mark hopes to see within the next decade. \n \nTweetables:\n\n“If I treated my patients the way I was trained to treat them — that would be malpractice because the field looks different, almost year by year now.” — @marklewismd [0:09:37]\n\n“Oncology is now so broad. There's no doctor I know that knows everything about cancer. It’s just impossible.” — @marklewismd [0:16:09]\n\n“This is a pivotal time in the development of molecular tests and imaging because ultimately if we're going to cure these people, either we need incredibly effective systemic therapies or we need to be finding them.” — @marklewismd [0:25:10]\n\n“The future of medicine is going to be genomically informed. There are certain diseases that we screen for at birth that have profound hereditary implications, but we don't yet screen for everything.” — @marklewismd [0:36:10]\n\n“Chemo is not something to play with. In this next decade, I would anticipate that we will become much better at selecting who requires these treatments and who doesn't.” — @marklewismd [0:42:35]\n\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/​​​​\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/​​​​​​ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY​​​​​​ \nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX​​​​​​\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU​​​​​​ \nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO​​​​​​ \n\nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94​​​​​​",

      "title": "When Mobile Payments Become Infrastructural with Hong Shen",
      "description": "Mobile payment services have become a day-to-day fixture in the lives of people and businesses in China, dominated by two leading players: Alipay and WeChat Pay. This episode centers around a conversation with Hong Shen, a systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon who put out a paper last year titled ‘I Can't Even Buy Apples If I Don't Use Mobile Pay?: When Mobile Payments Become Infrastructural in China’. The key word here is infrastructural. Hong believes that these services have become part of the very infrastructure of Chinese society and economy, and this is what she goes into detail about in today's episode. \n\nThis episode is a little unusual in that it was recorded in the fall of 2020 and never released. The reason for this is that it was originally meant to coincide with the release of Ant IPO, which as you probably remember, was cancelled. This interview is as relevant as ever, however, following recent developments on FinTech regulations and digital currency in China, and Hong makes the case that mobile payments are already so deeply integrated that it would be a difficult industry to disrupt. Tuning in, you’ll hear more about why mobile payments and QR took off so rapidly in China, and Hong elaborates on their “taxonomy of ubiquity.” You’ll also find out how people are using these systems to develop new social norms and practices, including some unique to the digital format. Tune in today!\n\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n• Hear a bit about Hong’s background and what sparked her interest in mobile payments.\n• Hong shares more detail about her paper and the concept of infrastructure they used.\n• Why mobile payments became ubiquitous in China so rapidly, including cheap, large-scale smartphone adoption.\n• The roles that the regulatory environment, government support, and company rebates play.\n• The proliferation of QR codes and how they are influencing Chinese economy and society.\n• Usage of Alipay versus WeChat Pay; how mobile pay practices were influenced by the parent company’s business focus.\n• Learn about the “taxonomy of ubiquity” of mobile payments in China: physical, digital, social. \n• How people are using mobile payment systems to develop new social norms and practices.\n• Whether Hong believes that the use cases of each app are interchangeable or sticky.\n• Find out more about the cultural significance of red packets and the major invention that was WeChat Pay’s digital alternative.\n• Some of the creative ways red packets are being used that are unique to the digital format.\n\nTweetables:\n\n“We borrow the concept of infrastructure because, through the experience of our participants, we deeply feel that mobile payments actually become those daily infrastructures in people's lives in China.” — @hongshenus\n\n“Based on our data, people actually developed their usage of mobile pay practices based on their previous use of the apps. This is why we see Alipay dominating the online shopping scenario and WeChat Pay dominating anything related with social networks.” — @hongshenus \n\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/podcasts/​\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/​​​ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\nTwitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY​​​ \nLinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX​​​\nFacebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU​​​ \nInstagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO​​​ \n \nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94​​​",

      "description": "As the year comes to an end, we would like to thank everyone who listened to the FYI — For Your Innovation podcast. 2020 will likely go down in history as the year of COVID-19, a year that forced us to battle a global pandemic and all the uncertainty that comes with it. In this final episode of 2020, we complied some of our most interesting podcast episodes for you. Please enjoy this summary and tune back in when we return in 2021.\n\n\n1. Battery Supply Chain for Electric Vehicles with Simon Moores and Vivas Kumar (EP 72)\n\nWe have Simon Moores and Vivas Kumar from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence here to discuss the often under-appreciated topic of battery supply chain and look at the present and future of the electric car battery industry.\n\n\n2. The Digital Economy with Gary Vaynerchuk (EP 82)\n\nARK sat down with Gary Vaynerchuk to talk about the future of the digital economy. Gary is a serial entrepreneur, five-times New York Times bestselling author, Chairman of VaynerX, CEO of VaynerMedia and VaynerSports.\n\n\n3. Be Creative. Together. With Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jared Geller (EP 65)\n\nWe enjoyed the conversation with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jared Geller. They joined FYI to speak about their platform, HitRecord, an online community built around creative collaboration. HitRecord offers artists of all kinds a platform to share their artwork or idea, and open it up to the input of other artists, thereby producing a trail that records the work’s progression much like GitHub does with code.\n\n\n4. The State of Genetic Testing in The US with Rob Metcalf (EP 79)\n\nIn episode 79 we were joined by Rob Metcalf, CEO of Concert Genetics, a private company looking to connect the genetic health information network and simplify the often-murky world of genetic testing. We heart about Rob’s entry into healthcare and his interest in the intersection of tech and real world problem-solving.\n\n\n5. Supersonic Travel with Blake Scholl, CEO of Boom Supersonic (EP 66)\n\nBlake Scholl, the CEO of Boom Supersonic, joined the FYI podcast to give us insights into the ambitions for supersonic travel. Boom aims to build the world’s fastest civil aircraft, twice as fast commercial flights.\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\n- Twitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY \n- LinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\n- Facebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU \n- Instagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO \n \nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "description": "Apps like WeChat are leading a wave of innovation in China and the world, quickly bringing China closer to the goal of becoming a technological superpower. In today’s episode, ARK Analyst, James Wang, interviews Matthew Brennan about the future of Chinese mobile technology and innovation. Matthew is a speaker and writer focusing specifically on mobile technology and innovation in China. In particular, he’s known for his analysis of social e-commerce and WeChat, China’s famous super app. He explains what a super app is – or isn’t – and how recommendation algorithms, video classification, and growth hacking have contributed to the rapid growth of companies like ByteDance. Find out how TikTok achieved international success, and hear Matthew weigh up the likelihood that short-video and live stream e-commerce will become popular in the near future in the US. Tune in today to find out more! \n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n• Matthew explains the short-form video trend and the rise of ByteDance in China.\n• The relationship between music.ly and ByteDance – TikTok is a clone of a clone of a clone.\n• Why TikTok’s recommendation algorithm is different from others, and what Kuaishou is.\n• How the TikTok recommendation algorithm works via the data and content flywheels.\n• The advancement of video classification technology over the past few years and how it assists with enriching user profiles.\n• Growth hacking and how it contributed to ByteDance’s success.\n• Why ByteDance needed to move fast to take the window of opportunity for TikTok in 2018.\n• When TikTok’s reputation took a turn and became the app of choice for teens and pre-teens.\n• Matthew weighs in in TikTok’s biggest threat and whether its growth trajectory is sustainable.\n• E-commerce and TikTok – the future of live stream and short video e-commerce.\n• Instagram Reels versus TikTok and the 2018 scramble to copy TikTok when it blew up.\n• Matthew shares some of the live stream e-commerce trends he has seen.\n• The discounting mechanism and how it plays into the success of e-commerce marketplaces like Pinduoduo, TaoBao, and Alibaba.\n• Matthew explains the super app phenomenon in China – it’s all about user acquisition costs.\n• Why WeChat is a real super app and the key to food-delivery app Meituan’s success.\n• Why it’s ByteDance’s game to lose right now and what their trajectory will be.\n\n\n“I think the success of ByteDance has been very encouraging for Chinese companies to finally have a global breakout hit. On the other hand, the political backlash has been very discouraging.” — @mbrennanchina \n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\n- Twitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY \n- LinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\n- Facebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU \n- Instagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO \n \nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "title": "The First AI Chip Startup with Naveen Rao, Nervana Systems",
      "description": "Over the past five years, over 50 companies dedicated to making artificial intelligence run faster have sprung up. Whether in data centers or in cars, like Tesla’s automobiles, all of these innova-tions arguably started with NVIDIA and the move to deep learning on graphics processing units (GPUs). This created an entire industry. The first AI chip company was Nervana Systems, and its Founder, Naveen Rao, joins us to shares his insights. In this episode, we hear about Naveen’s academic and professional backgrounds and how he used his engineering and neuroscience skills to start Nervana after working at Qualcomm. We discuss what fundraising for Nervana was like and how the venture capital (VC) landscape changed its attitude to hardware concurrent with Nervana’s growth and innovation. The company was ultimately acquired by Intel, and we learn about how it went from a business development proposition to acquisition. Naveen shares the personnel and resource constraints Nervana faced despite being part of a much larger organi-zation such as Intel, and how his role ultimately changed over time. While Intel has kept some of Nervana’s developments, they have also gone in different directions, and Naveen shares his take on this. The discussion also touches on Nervana and NVIDA’s love/hate relationship, what is piquing Naveen’s interest now that he is no longer at Intel, and where he thinks the outcomes of the work in the space are likely to lead. To hear more, tune in today!\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n· Naveen’s background and moving from engineering to computational neuroscience.\n· Hear about Naveen’s time as Qualcomm and the neuromorphic computing research he was doing.\n· How a failed internal pitch for an artificial neural network at Qualcomm led to Nervana’s crea-tion.\n· Nervana’s founding story, building the team, and fundraising for the company.\n· The difficulty of pitching chip investments to VCs, who has lost money in the early 2000s.\n· Changes in VC attitudes towards hardware by the time Nervana had raised 20 million dollars.\n· Hear more about the nature of Nervana’s relationship with NVIDIA.\n· How the deal with Intel went from biz dev to acquisition.\n· Some of the obstacles that came with being bought by a big company.\n· Getting an offer to head up the AI team at Intel and the challenges this brought for Naveen.\n· How the release of Volta, NVIDIA’s chip, changed the competition in the space.\n· The game plan changes after Volta’s release and splitting into inference and training paths.\n· The importance of patience in the space; NVDIA has always bet on their team.\n· Naveen’s position on Intel acquiring Habana and how his job changed after this acquisition.\n· Naveen’s impression of the AI companies that have sprouted up since.\n· Unpacking the critical software for this type of development.\n· Google’s GPU team and the advantage they have on the inference side.\n· NVIDA’s acquisitions and Naveen’s take on what they are trying to do.\n· What Naveen is up to now that he is no longer at Intel.\n\nTweetables:\n\n“Once we got acquired, we were actually put under a hiring freeze. It became very difficult, or ac-tually, impossible for us to hit any timelines, because we knew we had to grow by 50 people.” — @NaveenGRao [0:20:04]\n\n“I think, if Intel doesn't react well enough to actually maintain the markets they have, NVIDIA is going to eat at them and that's what they're going to do with Arm. That's really going to be painful.” — @NaveenGRao [0:47:18]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\n- Twitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY \n- LinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\n- Facebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU \n- Instagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO \n \nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "title": "Using Gene Editing to Cure HIV with Daniel Dornbusch",
      "description": "Viruses are specialists at replicating, something that has frustrated researchers for an HIV cure — until now. With advances in gene editing, the private company Excision BioTherapeutics seems to have developed a functional cure for HIV in animals by removing genomes. Today we speak with Excision CEO Daniel Dornbusch about their breakthrough and why, after decades, gene editing is now attracting significant attention. We open our conversation by talking about what gene editing is, its connections to health science, and how top minds have been experimenting with CRISPR to prevent viral infection. Daniel shares details on his company’s approach to an HIV cure while emphasizing that their research is derived from a community of scientific thought. From CasX to Cas9, we chat about different CRISPR proteins and how each has its abilities and aptitudes. After touching on the challenges of balancing effective gene editing with safety, Daniel provides his insights into why technological leaps have led to an explosion in the gene editing field. We then discuss how gene editing has accelerated the development of a Covid-19 vaccine before we ask Daniel for his take on the controversial 2018 story, when scientists allegedly edited the genes of babies. Near the end of the episode, we talk about other approaches to curing HIV and Daniel leaves us with a final message. Tune in to hear more about the exciting application of gene editing and what Daniel has done to push for an HIV cure.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n• We share the career highlights of Daniel Dornbusch, today’s guest. \n• Leading theories on the origin of HIV and why the disease is still worth discussing.\n• What gene editing is and its connections to health science.\n• Harnessing the power of CRISPR to edit genes and to avoid viral infections.\n• The differences between curing and treating viruses.\n• Developing a functional cure for HIV in animals by removing genomes.\n• Hear the details of how Daniel’s HIV curative treatment works. \n• Why Daniel’s company is focused on specifically curing HIV. \n• Exploring the different types of CRISPR proteins.\n• Balancing efficacy with safety in both drugs and gene editing.\n• Why gene editing is starting to take off.\n• How gene editing has accelerated the development of a Covid-19 vaccine.\n• Why vaccine trials move so slowly; the human body is complex and safety is paramount.\n• Commercializing gene editing and how viruses' natural characteristics have frustrated generations of gene editors — until now. \n\nTweetables:\n\n“With every drug, and throughout the history of drugs, there’s always a balance between efficacy and safety.” — Daniel Dornbusch\n\n“Gene editing has been a cornerstone of why we’ve moved so fast with new vaccines for the coronavirus.” — Daniel Dornbusch\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\n- Twitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY \n- LinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\n- Facebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU \n- Instagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO \n \nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "title": "Bitcoin As An Investment with Nate Maddrey",
      "description": "Despite being just over 10 years old, Bitcoin has experienced bear and bull markets. All the while, its value as an asset class has been misunderstood by traditional institutions and crypto enthusiasts alike. Today we speak with Nate Maddrey, Senior Analyst for Coin Metric, about why he believes you should consider investing in Bitcoin. We open our conversation by exploring the possibilities of on-chain analytics, which allows you to analyze the data of every Bitcoin transaction. We then dive into how Bitcoin evolved alongside a loss of trust in financial institutions and how Bitcoin solves many of the problems found in traditional trust-based economic models. After touching on how Bitcoin empowers individual stakeholders, we discuss Bitcoin’s rise from obscurity to becoming a battle-tested asset class. With Nate’s help, we answer the question of whether it’s too late to start investing in Bitcoin. From investing in an asset that can’t be seized or inflated by institutions, we explore Bitcoin’s maturity, market opportunities, its place within an investment portfolio, and how it compares with other asset classes and stocks. Near the end of the episode, we reflect on the impact that institutions are having on Bitcoin and why Bitcoin’s story seems to have only just begun. \n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n• Nate introduces himself and his role at Coin Metrics, a leading crypto asset data provider.\n• How on-chain analytics provide incredible access to data about crypto transactions.\n• Unpacking Bitcoin’s characteristics and why it should be seen as an asset class.\n• How Bitcoin evolved in relation to the financial industry. \n• Predictable economic assurances and comparing Bitcoin to traditional financial institutions.\n• Bitcoin’s open structure and how this flips the old model of keeping data behind closed doors.\n• Exploring Bitcoin’s history as a game-changing technology that appeared out of nowhere.\n• Why Bitcoin enthusiasts see its organic evolution and anonymous origins as a key feature.\n• The view that Bitcoin is still early in its path to monetization. \n• Investing in digital gold; the many market opportunities that Bitcoin presents. \n• Why Bitcoin is more than a payment network.\n• Bitcoin’s perfect fit within diversified investment portfolios and its low correlation with other assets.\n• Nate answers the big question, “Is Bitcoin mature enough to be an institutional asset?”\n• Comparing Bitcoin’s trading volume and liquidity against FANG stocks and other asset classes.\n• Why institutions have neglected Bitcoin and the impact that they could have on Bitcoin’s ethos.\n\nTweetables:\n\n“Bitcoin was founded in 2009 as a direct response to the 2008 financial crisis and the loss of trust in our traditional financial institutions.” — @natemaddrey \n\n“One of the exciting things about Bitcoin is you can send 10 million dollars’ worth of Bitcoin to the other side of the world for a couple of dollars and have it settle within 10 minutes to an hour.” — @natemaddrey \n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\n- Twitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY \n- LinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\n- Facebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU \n- Instagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO \n \nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "title": "The State of Genetic Testing in The US with Rob Metcalf",
      "description": "DNA sequencing, which is the foundational technological enabler of things like precision medi-cine and genetic testing has seen one of the most staggering cost decline curves in history. With the genetic testing landscape evolving so rapidly, stakeholders are struggling to keep up with developments. Today's guest is Rob Metcalf, CEO of Concert Genetics, a company looking to connect the genetic health information network and simplify the often-murky world of genetic test-ing. In this episode, we hear about Rob’s entry into healthcare and his interest in the intersection of tech and real-world problem-solving. Realizing there is potential not only for innovation but al-so for business growth, Concert—with Rob at the helm—has done exciting work to enable prac-tical solutions. Rob does not sugarcoat the complexity and the strides that still have to be made, so we hear about some of the obstacles in healthcare currently. Through a practical example, we gain insights into the complexity of the moving parts of genetic testing. The conversation also touches on direct customer payments and the exciting way this drives costs down. Of course, it is only one aspect of increased affordability, as Rob highlights, but it is an area where great shifts are happening. Along with this, we also unpack the way that COVID is likely to bring about change and the importance of understanding the economic significance of genetic testing devel-opments and innovation. Do not miss out on this incredible, timely discussion.\n\nhttp://www.personalizedmedicinecoalition.org/Userfiles/PMC-Corpo-rate/file/PMC_Understanding_Genomic_Testing_Utilization_and_Coverage_in_the_US2.pdf\n\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n• The Human Genome Project and the progress in DNA mapping progression since.\n• Some of the barriers of translating genomes into clinical practice.\n• Rob’s background in machine learning and his transition into the healthcare space.\n• That we are coming into an age of personalized medicine where research is being applied.\n• Unpacking the major pain points in the healthcare space and the moving parts.\n• Understanding the patient experience through the example of non-invasive prenatal screening.\n• The complexity that comes with getting paid by an insurer in this space.\n• How direct cash payments from patients changes the dynamics of pricing.\n• Why the oncology space and treatment are not likely to be shifted by patient payment.\n• The exciting developments in the earlier stages of cancer diagnostics.\n• The outcomes of testing developments are as much economic and health.\n• How COVID and heightened awareness generally is likely to impact testing and diagnostics.\n• The digitization of healthcare and some of the opportunities it holds.\n• Data struggles are already happening now because of infrastructure constraints.\n• Personalized health is a multi-stakeholder problem, which makes it so complex.\n• Topics at the Genetic Health Information Network Summit.\n• Concert’s approach to finding solutions for practical problems.\n\nTweetables:\n\n“At a very high level, I think we are, with genetics and personalized medicine, trying to solve some important problems around health. We're trying to find cures for diseases. We're trying to im-prove the health of our follow humans and we’re trying to do that in a way that leverages a grow-ing understanding of the world around us.” — Rob Metcalf [0:07:50]\n\n“We’re trying to enable and advance personalized medicine by building some of the fundamental infrastructure that enables people to do the math.” — Rob Metcalf [0:10:11]\n\n“The question in situations, genetic testing, like that [cancer] is what is the value of the genetic test as it relates to the overall set of outcomes and cost of those outcomes? We're not well-equipped to answer that question today.” — Rob Metcalf [0:28:46]\n\n“We want services that are coming to bear, tech-enabled, Moore’s law driven innovations, that drive down prices in these things where people see value. It doesn’t mean we’re not going to need experts and societies and infrastructure to collect and measure data to do utility studies. It just means it shouldn’t be the only thing, the only horse we’re betting on.” — Rob Metcalf [0:44:05]\n\n“Change does not just come from big organizations and government decrees; it actually comes from people, relationships, understanding the problem, defining the problem, and working to-gether.” — Rob Metcalf [0:48:10]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\n- Twitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY \n- LinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\n- Facebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU \n- Instagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO \n \nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "description": "Are you suffering from headache, nausea, or increased blood pressure from the threat of disruptive innovation? If so, you may be associated with a portfolio that is based on the traditional world order.\n\nMany investors want to achieve long-term growth, but appear to be worried about the short-term volatility associated with innovative companies. They fear companies that offer newer, faster, cheaper, and more creative products and services, and, based on history, prefer broad based indexes, which include physical bank branches, bricks and mortar retail, linear television, freight rail, and traditional transportation. \n\nShould investment portfolios stay the same as they've always been?

      "title": "Venture Capital Changes, Business Education, and the US Supply Chain with Steve Blank",
      "description": "The coronavirus has sent shockwaves through every sector, and venture capital has not been left unscathed. Today's guest, Steve Blank, is here to unpack some of these changes along with several other topics, including business education, and the US supply chain’s entanglement with China. Steve is a Silicon Valley veteran, serial startup founder, and Professor of Entrepreneurship at Stanford. He is also, along with Eric Ries, the creator of the influential Lean Startup Movement. \n\nIn this episode, we look at the state of venture capital. Steve draws our attention to what he calls the elongation of going public and how this limits the number of players in the tech space, the evolution of founders’ powers, and how angel investing has come to be what it is today. We also touch on the capacity of startup formation in the years to come. Steve implores us to rethink the current landscape and imagine what it would be like if small businesses were incentivized in the same way big corporations are. A conversation with Steve would not be complete without touching on the “Lean” methodology. After giving us a quick refresher of what it entails, he discusses the influence it's had on businesses. We round the show off with a look at the East Coast versus West Coast approaches to teaching business and the pain points of the US technology supply chain in light of mounting tensions with China. To hear more, tune in today!\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n• An overview of the state of venture capital and some of the major changes over the past decade.\n• The advantages and drawbacks of companies staying private for longer. \n• Why people are starting to question whether it is important to return to a sense of profitability.\n• There wasn’t always liquidity for founders or VCs; they had to wait until a company went public or was bought out.\n• How dual-class stock has changed the balance of power for founders.\n• Hear about how angel investing has become increasingly professionalized since the ‘70s.\n• The unique phenomenon where experienced tech execs are recirculated within the system.\n• Developments Steve noticed around the maturation of innovation clusters in China.\n• Steve’s take on whether there are capped number of founders. \n• A thought experiment where there are disincentives for companies growing larger.\n• The contrasting level of support for big and small businesses in the US.\n• Singapore and Israel’s prolific innovation capabilities and ability to punch above their weight.\n• The philosophy behind Lean Startup and the two ways it subverted startup-related thinking.\n• How the Lean methodology has come in and out of fashion with startups over time.\n• The often-conflicting business models and values between founders and investors.\n• Why government regulation can be useful in leveling the playing field in tech.\n• Shifts Steve has seen during his time in education and his opinion on the relevancy of MBAs.\n• The consequences of a trade war given how entwined the US supply chain is with China.\n• Steve’s blog post about the ‘Chip War’ and some key takeaways from it.\n\nTweetables\n\n“There's another wave of how to train entrepreneurs that are radically different than how we trained professional management class based on cases.” — @sgblank [0:43:40]\n\n“The way we might actually see the future is not necessarily a linear extrapolation from the past. That's a big idea and it could be interesting.” — @sgblank [0:49:54]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\n- Twitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY \n- LinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\n- Facebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU \n- Instagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO \n \nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "description": "A lot of our focus is on pro and varsity-level esports and gaming, but the recreational esports community is really taking off, especially now that the COVID-19 pandemic has put a hold on physical sporting events. \n\nToday’s guest is Austin Smith, co-founder and CEO of Mission Control, a St. Louis-based company with a mission to gather and grow communities, focusing on recreational esports. Mission Control utilizes the nature of gaming to create digitally organized social experiences that drive connection through shared passions and playful competition, not profits and competitive play. In this episode, Austin shares the founding story and vision for Mission Control, from the organizations they work with, to how the league management software and mobile app actually work. \n\nWe discuss the unique scoring types they offer, what differentiates Mission Control from their competitors, and gaming as a social experience, as well as the market opportunity for software like this. Along with this, we explore why Mission Control only promotes recreational play, and what it is like being a startup in St. Louis. Tune in today to find out more about gathering and growing communities in the rec league esports space!\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n• Austin starts off with an introduction to Mission Control and a bit about his own background.\n• The types of organizations Mission Control works with, from college intramural rec departments to private institutions like YMCA.\n• How the Mission Control league management software and mobile app for players work.\n• There are currently 11 games on the platform, with a larger array coming soon!\n• Adding new games and unique scoring types, creating new ways to play a game.\n• How COVID-19 has impacted Mission Control, and how they can help by creating connection.\n• The integration required to support a new game, depending on self-reporting and validation.\n• Relationships and partnerships Mission Control has had with specific game publishers.\n• Mission Control’s competitors and what differentiates them – their hyper-focus on rec and gaming as a social experience, not a competitive one.\n• The market opportunity for multiplayer community gaming, just in the US, let alone worldwide.\n• Why Mission Control is only interested in building software that promotes recreational play.\n• Mission Control’s founding story, and the advantages of building a startup in St. Louis.\n• Groups and organizations that support startups and economic development in St. Louis.\n• Austin talks about how Mission Control raised a $1.75 million seed financing round.\n• How Austin thinks the pandemic will impact the gaming ecosystem and what part Mission Control will play.\n\nTweetables:\n“People need each other in chaotic times, yet the definition of this chaotic time is that we cannot be with each other. How can you lean on your community if you can’t be with your community? Well, you have to use digital mediums, and what we are is a community organizer over a digital medium. We’re something that people can use right now to lean on each other.” — @austinmilesmith [0:09:12]\n\n“I like being right there at the bottom, offering gaming as this social community experience. I think that, at its core, is incredibly different.” — @austinmilesmith [0:16:42]\n\n“We are focused on building a software that makes it easier for all gamers to play in a recreational, community, social way. That’s what we are going to continue focusing on.” — @austinmilesmith [0:20:53]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nTo learn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/ \n \nFor more updates, follow us on:\n- Twitter: https://arkinv.st/3corDiY \n- LinkedIn: http://arkinv.st/1f7AiVX\n- Facebook: http://arkinv.st/3r4EDOU \n- Instagram: http://arkinv.st/39td8bO \n \nDisclosure: http://arkinv.st/39rzF94",

      "title": "The Coming Dawn of Self-Driven Cars with Oliver Cameron",
      "description": "While there are debates about whether the deployment of fully autonomous vehicles will happen in one or several years, everyone agrees that the coming moment is very close. In this episode, we chat with Oliver Cameron, co-founder and CEO of Voyage, a self-driving car company focused on bringing their technology to market as soon as possible, serving those who need it the most. \n\nAt this point, Voyage is on the very cusp of providing fully autonomously driven cars. Oliver gives us an idea of their go-to-market strategy that involves catering to senior citizens in retirement communities before talking about the role that testing in these environments has played in the progression of their technology as well as the roll-out of their products. He also lets us know what a market-ready car needs to be able to do, and the significance of the difference between one car that works all the time and another that doesn’t. We get into the tech stack that is being employed in Voyage cars next, talking about computing power and sensors, why the team chose Chrysler’s Pacifica as their model of choice, and what their cars are currently capable of doing. \n\nOliver sketches out the computational procedure a self-driving car performs while on the road and gives some idea of how few milliseconds the process should take. This window of time a car has to make decisions in is small, offering little leg room where costly tradeoffs are being made making driving at high speeds or in busy environments the horizon for new breakthroughs. Oliver also shares his thoughts about the industry during COVID-19, what widely publicized crashes mean for regulations, and what startups should expect to raise to pay for the costly tech these cars use!\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n- Oliver’s background in Udacity’s founding team, designing courses about self-driving cars.\n- The origins of Voyage, who they serve, and the level of their autonomous driving tech.\n- Testing the tech for Voyage in small towns and senior communities, their target markets.\n- Challenges Voyage encountered in its mission to cater to senior communities.\n- Voyage’s place in arguments about when fully autonomous driving will arrive.\n- Taking driverless cars from an experiment that mostly works to a safe marketable product.\n- How becoming market-ready means enabling the car to know when it needs help.\n- Voyage’s go-to-market strategy; gaining momentum after dominating the retirement community niche.\n- Businesses that gain and those that suffer due to COVID-19, and how Voyage is faring.\n- The car model Voyage uses, its limitations and capabilities, and the self-driving tech it uses.\n- Different aims and computational tech changes in the Voyage products per generation.\n- Voyage’s use of LiDAR in its sensor suite; thoughts on sensor bias and camera sensors.\n- Regulations and thoughts on Uber’s widely publicized crash.\n- Plans for tackling the final puzzle pieces; hardware and software solutions to car confusion.\n- Better sensors, better data, or better algorithms? Oliver’s take on the final steps.\n- The technical procedure behind a car driving itself, and the minimum milliseconds needed.\n- Performance vs latency tradeoffs: does good AI even matter if it’s slow?\n- Thoughts on Waymo’s quietness; are they in trouble or just being cautious?\n- Companies Oliver respects and why he has doubts about autonomous trucking.\n- The amount of capital needed to fund essential labeling and data pipelines.\n\nTweetables:\n\n“What really separates Voyage from the rest is that we are focused on bringing the technology to market as soon as possible, serving those who need it the most.” — @olivercameron [0:02:24]\n\n“One of the things that doesn’t really get talked that much about is this transition from an RND project or science project to commercial-grade technology.” — @olivercameron [0:06:12]\n\n“The type of sensor is not important, it’s just having the stability of all you can in the environment around you with the reliability that you expect. I don’t care that it’s a LiDAR, a radar, a camera – just tell me that an object is there.” — @olivercameron [0:24:48]\n\n“Every time you optimize for the latency, you make a tradeoff in the performance of it.” — @olivercameron [0:40:49]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nLearn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n\nDisclosure: http://bit.ly/1C5DBVL",

      "title": "Podcast Monetization Through Subscriptions with Jason Sew Hoy, CEO of Supercast",
      "description": "Podcasts have been around for over a decade, but the surge in listenership and engagement has only happened over the past few years. Through mobile internet and its extended reach, people now have a platform to start podcasts and deliver their show to thousands of users. Ordinary people can share their expertise without having to conform to conventional broadcasting standards. With the ever-rising popularity of the medium, many companies have capitalized on the growing market. \n\nSupercast is a startup that helps the podcast industry monetize off subscription services. CEO, Jason Sew Hoy, is our today’s guest, and he gives us a look behind the curtain. In this episode, Jason sheds light on how the Supercast platform works and what they’re doing to foster the passion rather than the gig economy. While the latter has worked out incredibly well on the supplier side, it flattens the creator’s skills and monetizes their time. By creating recurring revenue, Supercast hopes to help podcasters essentially get paid in their sleep along with creating direct, intimate connections between hosts and audiences. \n\nWe also learn more about how a customized user feed enables the platform to have a better security as well as target their customers with content they want to listen to. Jason believes that we’re only at the very early days of what it means to monetize audio. He shares more on the Chinese podcast market and how it’s reached $8 billion in value. Along with this, Jason also covers Apple and Spotify’s role in the podcast market, how YouTube could be the dark horse of podcasting, and what the future has in store for Supercast. Be sure to tune in today!\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n- Why the podcast space has seen such explosive growth over the past few years.\n- Learn more about Supercast, the niche they fill, and what drew Jason to the company.\n- Passion economy versus gig economy: The differences and how they serve creators differently.\n- Learn about how podcast subscription works and how willing audiences are to subscribe.\n- Find out how Supercast allows the audience to have access to premium content.\n- How the Supercast architecture works and the protection protocol to keep content exclusive.\n- The growth potential of podcasts and a look at China’s podcast market’s incredible success.\n- Jason’s take on what Apple and Spotify’s approach to podcasts and where it could go.\n- Why Jason has doubts about dynamic ads being as effective as host-read ones.\n- Learn more about Descript, an incredible podcast editing service.\n- What’s on the horizon for Supercast, how it’s scaling, and how they’re using recent funding\n- How podcasters can capitalize on YouTube and leverage the platform’s enormous reach.\n- The effect of the lockdown on podcasts and why the decline in engagement isn’t bad.\n\nTweetables:\n\n“The spoken medium is just something that comes natural to us as human beings.” — @jswehoy [0:01:51]\n\n“What the passion economy does specifically for creators is super interesting. Rather than monetizing people's time and flattening their skills into broad groups of common tasks, the passion economy actually embraces people's unique individuality.” — @jswehoy [0:05:09]\n\n“People are very willing to pay for specialized content in a particular niche that has been created with a lot of thought of attention.” — @jswehoy [0:15:26]\n\n“One of the amazing things about podcasting is that really makes use of your ability to multitask.” — @jswehoy [0:32:47]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nLearn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n\nDisclosure: http://bit.ly/1C5DBVL",

      "title": "Innovation Isn’t Voluntary with Jim McKelvey, Co-founder of Square",
      "description": "What does it mean to be a true entrepreneur? And what does it take to build a resilient, world-changing company? Jim McKelvey has some ideas. Today, we’re joined by the Co-founder of Square, who has recently published a book called The Innovation Stack. In this episode, we talk about the book, its implications on Square, but also on the broader business environment, especially under the current circumstances – as we are all together in this unprecedented crisis caused by the COVID-19 virus. Jim elaborates on his story, including Square’s battle with Amazon in 2014. It’s a curious tale, for sure, and Jim will explain. We explore the origins of Square and its offerings, as well as Jim’s definition of an entrepreneur and why he believes that innovation isn’t a choice. Finally, Jim tells listeners about his nonprofit, LaunchCode, and how it has really taken off during the pandemic. Tune in to learn more.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n\n- Jim tells listeners more about his book and the graphic novel it was meant to be\n- How Jim met Jack Dorsey and ended up founding Square with him\n- The pyramid structure of product offerings\n- Building a business that already exists and using an old definition of ‘entrepreneur’\n- Replicating existing solutions versus being forced to innovate\n- Innovations stacks as a competitive advantage\n- How Square chose to handle Amazon copying their product in 2014\n- The importance of sharing tools and skills during a crisis\n- How Cash App represents disenfranchised individuals\n- Cash App as a valuable solution during the COVID-19 pandemic\n- More about Jim’s new nonprofit LaunchCode.org\n- Why Jim believes innovation isn’t voluntary and is often sparked by crisis\n\nTweetables:\n\n“If you have a problem that you're trying to solve and there is an existing solution that you can copy, you should probably copy that solution. Only if it is such a unique problem that there is no good solution out there, should you begin the messy process of innovation”\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nLearn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n\nDisclosure: http://bit.ly/1C5DBVL",

While many don’t believe we are on the threshold of curing disease, we do.

For that, we asked Jacqueline Reses, the Capital Lead at Square to answer our questions on the future of finance.

      "description": "Our guest today, Blake Scholl, the CEO of Boom Supersonic, is here to give us insights into the ambitions for supersonic travel. Boom aims to build the world’s fastest civil aircraft, twice as fast commercial flights. Blake gives us some background and history of the space, sharing insights into why so many projects seemed to fail and the general move away from these ideas. He updates us on why the technology has potentially caught up with the aspirations and just how beneficial these shortened travel times can be, from a convenience, cost, and industrial standpoint. Blake fills us in on Boom’s current state and when it might be expected to be rolled out. He details the way they intend to bring this option to market, activating latent demand and hopefully allowing prices to come down as the market grows. We also get into the nuts and bolts of the tech, discuss 3D printing, the business culture at Boom, and how they have gone about finding funding.

      "title": "Be Creative. Together. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jared Geller Talk About HitRecord",
      "description": "The ostensible premise behind social media platforms is to enable people to connect online, but this gets jeopardized by their attention economy architecture and paid advertising algorithms. Today’s guests are Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jared Geller and they join us to speak about their platform, HitRecord, an online community built around creative collaboration. HitRecord offers artists of all kinds a platform to share their artwork or idea, and open it up to the input of other artists, thereby producing a trail that records the work’s progression much like GitHub does with code. In our conversation with Joseph and Jared, we hear about HitRecord’s journey from its early days as a production company to its current state as a tech company, offering decentralized access and editing capabilities to creative projects around the world. Our guests talk about some of the functionality on HitRecord and weigh in on some of the limitations of social media. We also explore the future of the movie industry, the blurring lines between creativity and technology, and what kinds of creative and community-driven art forms could grow out of quarantine and the pandemic. \n\nMake sure to check out their latest project “Create Together #WithMe”, a new Youtube series about making art and community out of uncertain times. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5giS_Ka9TKY\n\n\nKey Points From This Episode:\n- Introducing HitRecord, an online community built around creative collaboration\n- Collaboration versus likes: connecting online differently to what social media allows\n- Open-source culture: drawing from GitHub and Lawrence Lessig’s Remix for HitRecord\n- Being a ‘tech company’ and similarities between a software developer and an artist mindset\n- Controlling crediting and diverging from an idea through ‘remixing’ other artists’ work\n- The rules around attribution on HitRecord which allows contributing artists to get paid\n- How the scope of projects made on HitRecord has grown and thoughts for its future\n- The role technology played in making HitRecord’s contribution process more decentralized\n- The value to be found by seeing and experiencing the process behind creative works\n- Taking YouTube’s enablement of getting seen further by foregrounding the creative process\n- Problem-solving using data versus emotion: the merge between tech and creative mindsets\n- Hollywood’s heyday in the 1930s and thoughts about the evolution of the movie industry\n- The increased use of HitRecord in the pandemic and exciting creative fields right now\n- TikTok’s genesis story and the pros and cons of the platform: music versus monetization\n- The double-edged sword of new technologies that become invisible but indispensable\n- Lesser-known Joseph Gordon-Levitt films to watch during the quarantine\n\n\nTweetables:\n\n“HitRecord is a community built around creative collaboration. A lot of art and creativity online is people posting things they’ve made on their own, and building up their own audience, which can be great, of course. But on HitRecord, it’s less about, ‘Look at what I made,’ and it’s more about, ‘What can we make together?”\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nLearn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n\nDisclosure: http://bit.ly/1C5DBVL",

      "description": "Today on the show, we welcome Austin Petersmith, Founder and CEO of Capiche. Capiche is a startup that aims to bring transparency and trusted reviews to the world of enterprise software. The SaaS industry has blossomed in recent years with dozens of tools being used across productivity, communication, databases and DevOps. In this episode, Austin gives an overview of how the modern software as a service (SaaS) industry was born and what’s coming down the pike. We hear the gap in the enterprise software customer experience that Capiche aims to fulfill and what the benefits are of having a communal space that fosters a mentality of users-helping-users. We also discuss the range of software available to us today and how the traditional top-down decision-making power within these structures is stretching across all employees into the hands of the individual. With more and more people settling into remote work during the coronavirus lockdowns, we explore the importance of having trust within organizations and why this is the most important leadership quality that needs to be practiced, right now. \n\nKey Points from This Episode:\n- Discover how Austin got interested in enterprise software and how Capiche began.\n- The frustration with most software review sites when trying to find the right tools to use.\n- The core differences between a personal peer-review and vendor-controlled review sites. \n- Discover what Capiche is, how it works, and the gap it fills in the software community.\n- The value of building a community around more honest and insightful conversations.\n- Users helping users: Find out more about the discussions taking place on Capiche.\n- Learn more about the mechanism Capiche uses to acquire users and get them to engage.\n- The state of software for productivity today and the bottom-up adoption of software.\n- Find out more about the SaaS trend and the consumerization of enterprise software.\n- Using a well-known, established product versus using a new startup product.\n- Is it really that easy for companies to chop and change software products today?\n- Discover the general reception of Microsoft Teams among the Capiche community.\n- Who is going to be the next Slack? Promising products to look out for on the horizon.\n- Why trust is the most important thing when working remotely during the coronavirus.\n\nTweetables:\n“There are these review sites, but they don’t do a great job of getting a lot of depth.” — @awwstn [0:05:26]\n\n“There has been a power shift. People up and down an organization have a new voice.” — @awwstn [0:13:40]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nLearn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n\nDisclosure: http://bit.ly/1C5DBVL",

There’s perhaps no better example than in the education space. For six years 2U noted that one of the biggest challenges was fighting the stigma of online education, and then in the midst of COVID-19 nearly every school has been forced into an online only setting. Tune in to hear Chip walk us through 2U’s critical role in helping schools’ transition from the classrooms to online. We talk about the challenges of 2U, how online learning can create more engaging classes, and how 2U’s scale can help lower the cost of higher education.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:  \n-2U’s role in transitioning both itself and its partner schools online during the COVID-19\n-2U’s founding principles and what makes it unique\n-The difference between a lecture on Zoom and a program specifically designed to be online\n-Professors’ reactions to teaching online for the first time\n-The history and potential future of online education\n-Looking at education as an elastic good and creating a sustainable business model\n-Comparing online education outcomes through 2U and Gallup’s first survey\n-Reasons enterprises are turning to short courses and bootcamps\n-The lasting power of university brands\n-2U’s global expansion\n-Chip’s favorite brand, book, and the next short course he plans to take\n\nTweetables\n“High quality education online isn't just about being in a live classroom via Zoom or Google Hangout.” @ChipPaucek\n\n“At one point we won’t call it online education anymore, we will just call it higher education.” @ChipPaucek\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nLearn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n\nDisclosure: http://bit.ly/1C5DBVL",

      "title": "Business As Usual During Coronavirus - How Innovation Enables Work Remote",
      "description": "Here at ARK we are always talking about disruption and now we are faced with huge disruption. The coronavirus outbreak has massive implications on many levels for the whole world, not least of which is the need for many people to work remote where possible. This episode is a discussion about what that looks like during a time of mass quarantine. We are focusing our discussion on the realms of communication and entertainment. \n\nFirst of all, we discuss video conferencing and naturally, our eyes are on Zoom. Having grown rapidly in the last few years, Zoom will probably prove to be even more important as social distancing is enforced. From there we turn to messaging and texting in a professional context, looking at Slack in particular. We consider some of the other concerns in this period of remote work, particularly security and how the cloud has helped businesses alleviate security concerns. The conversation then turns to entertainment, as we first look at professional sports events, almost all of which have been postponed or canceled, and what might take their place in people's lives. We can already see E-sports growing, even before the outbreak. We finish off talking about television and movies, arguing that on-demand services will probably strengthen under current conditions with traditional cable suffering due to the absence of sports. Listen in to get it all!\n\nKey Points From This Episode:  \n-The new outlook on working from home in a time of crisis  \n-Eric Yuan, the beginnings of Zoom and the rise of video conferencing software\n-How Zoom has managed to gain market share\n-Possible problems and roadblocks for Zoom as more people need more time on video\n-Zoom's hardware, in-house data centers and excess capacity for scaling\n-Reasons for Zoom's hyper-competitiveness in today's market\n-Real-time, quick communication through text messaging; Teams versus Slack\n-Security concerns in the remote work realm and the benefits of cloud applications\n-The outlook for these high-value companies in the context of coronavirus\n-Looking at entertainment right now and the rise of gaming in lieu of live sports\n-Twitch-streamed virtual sports events and the possibility of celebrity partnerships\n-Regular, amateur gaming numbers in the US with new big event games\n-On-demand television and movie entertainment\n\nTweetables\n“I think with the absence of live sports what we are really starting to see is online gaming taking off.” — @GrousARK\n\n“There will obviously be a fall off when we do resume normal life but I think it is demonstrating this idea that watching virtual sporting events and virtual games is actually very entertaining.” — @GrousARK\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nLearn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n\nDisclosure: http://bit.ly/1C5DBVL",

      "description": "Eleven years since the creation of Bitcoin, its security model is still not agreed upon. Our guest today goes by the Twitter pseudonym Hasu (@hasufl), an independent cryptocurrency researcher who publishes work on the subject of non-sovereign money and has taken a recent interest in Bitcoin’s security model. \n\nWe kick off our conversation with a recognition of the power of pseudonymity in the digital realm and the implications of our ability to access an abundance of information in a post-internet world. We then take a deep dive into the world of Bitcoin, unpacking its security model. We begin with an explanation of Satoshi Nakamato’s explicit design goals to achieve the properties of an apolitical monetary system. We introduce an intuitive way of thinking about proof of work, highlighting Bitcoin’s innovative ability to coordinate trust, and facilitate the transfer of value without relying on a centralized authority. \n\nWe explain why Bitcoin needs mining and how the network incentivizes miners. We place particular emphasis on the economic incentives required to secure Bitcoin and a potential shift in these incentives over time. We finish with an outline of countermeasures against a potentially weakening security model, in hopes to further encourage conversation.\n\nKey Points From This Episode\n-The transition from information scarcity to information abundance since the internet\n-Democratic values provided by the internet and its culture of pseudonyms\n-Satoshi’s design goals and Bitcoin’s security principles  \n-Why Bitcoin needs mining  \n-Timestamping with Nakamoto consensus  \n-Miners’ influence on the network: what miners can and can’t do  \n-How to think about proof-of-work  \n-What secures Bitcoin: a combination of cryptography and economic incentives  \n-Acknowledging a shift in Bitcoin’s security model from block rewards to transaction fees  \n-Countermeasures to Bitcoin’s changing security model\n\nTweetables\n“Money and finance are spaces that have historically had huge barriers to entry and largely been protected from disruption. Cryptocurrency is able to exist outside of the curfew of government regulation.” — @hasufl \n\n“The market value of rewards is tied to the health of the network. As a result, the entire balance sheet of miners is tied to the health of the network. If users lose faith, miners lose their investment.” — @hasufl\n\n“If there ends up being a problem, and we are in a hurry to fix things, then it's way easier to make a mistake, adopt an imperfect solution, or implement something without full community buy-in.” — @hasufl\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nLearn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n\nDisclosure: http://bit.ly/1C5DBVL",

      "title": "The Future of Cultured Meat Production with Yaakov Nahmias",
      "description": "Today’s episode is part two of the discussion with Professor Yaakov Nahmias, the Israeli biomedical engineer and innovator. We discuss his startup, Future Meat Technologies, a company funded by Tyson Foods, which is poised to develop the next generation of cultured meat.\n\nInitially when someone proposed the idea of cultured meat to him, Yaakov thought it would be too expensive. Drawing inspiration from the human body’s filtration and purification system, Future Meat Technologies is working on a bioreactor which removes the growth inhibiting ammonia from the cell growth process. With this breakthrough development, the company has a plan to drastically drive down the cost of cultured meat production and improve efficiency to the point where it could surpass the output of the conventional meat industry. This may not only feed more people, but also allow consumers to make more conscious decisions. Yaakov recognizes that it is a niche market and in order to widen the customer base it is important to make the product as close to conventional meat as possible.\n\nKey Points From This Episode:  \n-An explanation of what cultured meat is  \n-Meat is made up of muscle and fat, so to mimic the taste in cultured meat, only fat is needed  \n-What fibroblasts are and why Yaakov’s company favors using them over other cells  \n-Why this new way of producing meat can be cheaper than using a conventional bioreactor  \n-How Future Meat Technologies’ purifying device works  \n-Why this way of producing meat is not genetically modified  \n-Why this technology’s shorter time frame allows for a higher level of market responsiveness  \n-What the most popular items in the meat market currently are  \n-What Yaakov envisions the future cultured meat industry to look like \n\nTweetables\n“If you want to make a burger that tastes and smells like meat, you actually don’t need all the meat, you need the fat.” — Yaakov Nahmias\n\n“Efficiency here is the name of the game. You don’t have a lot of margins. If this was a high margin industry then there would be more room for a couple of players.” — Yaakov Nahmias\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nLearn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n\nDisclosure: http://bit.ly/1C5DBVL",

In addition to that, Morgan is managing partner at AIR Summit, a network and conference targeted at the capital market industry and, in particular, capital market startups. \n\nIn the podcast, we are going to discuss the capital market space within FinTech, an area that is often overlooked amongst the hype you see around consumer FinTech startups and large venture rounds.\n\nKey Points from This Episode\n-More about Bendigo Partners and their two main concerns of investing and advising  \n-What the term “alpha tech” refers to and how it differentiates them from the rest of FinTech  \n-AIR Summit’s focus on capital markets, and specifically front office  \n-The growing media coverage on consumer FinTech rather than B2B capital markets  \n-How personal investing and the capital market are related  \n-The positive response from the industry to capital market startups  \n-Why companies are occupied with big data and how AI is being used to solve problems  \n-The competition for talent and why it is important to create the right culture  \n-Time as one of the biggest challenges for emerging technology companies  \n-General problems that the buy and sell side of the industry experience \n\nTweetables\n“Even within capital markets, we’re really focused on just the front office, so our sweet spot is actively managed funds, [mutual] fund complexes, and we’re really focused on bringing forward ideas, technology, data sets that can help those firms add alpha to their process.” — Morgan Dunbar [0:05:57]\n\n“So it is one thing to try to recruit and retain those people and just pay them. It is another thing to create a place where they actually feel like they’re solving problems and have support and can work in a methodological approach, a philosophical approach to the way they like to solve problems.” — Morgan Dunbar [0:25:26]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nLearn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n\nDisclosure: http://bit.ly/1C5DBVL",

      "description": "On today’s episode, we are joined by our first ever anonymous guest, who goes by the name of Dylan. James came across him on Twitter and was inspired by his fresh and innovative insights on semiconductors. \n\nDylan works in data science for a large company, but is interested in semiconductors and AI as a personal side project. Having been one of the most stagnant sectors, the semiconductor landscape has dramatically shifted and is now one of the most dynamic and vibrant sectors today. This appears clear as indicated by the meteoric rise of AI chip startups as well as autonomous car developments. Dylan, as an independent analyst, shares some of his background, what spurred his interest, and how his views are different from other analysts. \n\nHe talks about the state of the chip market, such as current innovations, what the role of trade tensions are, mobile slowdowns and market saturation, to name a few. Then together with ARK analyst Tasha Keeney, he provides an overview of what is unfolding in the self-driving car space in relation to semiconductors, discussing topics such as what current competition there is in the market, anticipated levels of autonomy and whether claims around full autonomy could ever be realized. For this and many more semiconductor insights, join us today!\n\nKey Points From This Episode\n-The reasons that independent analysts may be often better than traditional analysts\n-Which exciting things investors should be focused on\n-The projected power dynamics in the semiconductor sector\n-Why NVIDIA should be able to stay competitive\n-What the current market leaders’ prospects in the self-driving car sector will be\n-Some of the shortcomings with current chips in autonomous car development\n-Why claims of complete autonomy may never be realized\n-Some of the key differences among the competitors in the autonomous car market\n\nTweetables\n“The training market is beginning to get saturated.” — @dylan522p [0:12:27]\n\n“The reason why I thought trucks would become autonomous first was that there is more money involved.” —  @dylan522p [0:32:40]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nLearn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n\nDisclosure: http://bit.ly/1C5DBVL",

      "description": "On today’s episode your host and ARK analyst, Tasha Keeney, sits down with the chairman of Materialise, Peter Leys. \n\nMaterialise NV (“Materialise”) is a leading 3D printing firm that specializes in software and solutions for 3D printing for the medical and manufacturing space. You might know the company for their Materialise Build Processor, one of the most commonly used pieces of software across many different 3D printing manufacturers. \n\nPeter has been with the company since 2013, but has long been involved in an advisory capacity and has witnessed Materialise’s development to date. We discuss the multitude of advantages of 3D printing, including significantly reducing production costs and enabling greater creativity and freedom of design. Peter talks about the different industries that can benefit from this technology and how the transformation from traditional manufacturing to additive manufacturing is a slow yet inevitable process. He also shares his views about the level of investor interest, what the main focus of Materialise is and how the market will increasingly become consumer rather than product orientated. \n\nBe sure to join us for more about the exciting world of 3D printing!\n\nDisclosure: As of 4/30/19, ARK holds more than 5% of the shares outstanding for Materialise.\n\nKey Points From This Episode \n-How deciding on their IPO fits into their ‘built to last’ philosophy and vision for Materialise  \n-Defining 3D printing and how if differs from subtractive and transformative manufacturing  \n-Why greater complexity and freedom of design are possible with additive manufacturing  \n-Reduced cost of variety and short time to market as some of the biggest advantages  \n-The many different industries that can benefit from this level of customization  \n-Using the eyewear industry as an example to illustrate the possibilities with additive printing  \n-Why investors might still be hesitant and the unknown variable in the ecosystem  \n-New opportunities for switching over to additive manufacturing in the medical field  \n-Their focus on knowledge and communicating that knowledge to the world  \n-Where Materialise is positioned in the market and how they collaborate with other companies  \n-Timing and attracting talent as two major challenges they face as an innovation company  \n-Shifting from a product-centered to a consumer-centered economy\n\nTweetables\n“With additive, whether I am building layer by layer the very straightforward box or a very complex gearing wheel, cost basically remains the same. In other words, I can make very complex parts without adding much to the production cost.” — Peter @MaterialiseNV [0:06:32]\n\n“But what makes it very unique is that the company has always been focusing on knowledge. We are selling knowledge. We are gathering knowledge about this new exciting technology and we want to share that knowledge with the world.” — Peter @MaterialiseNV [0:34:47]\n\nMore FYI Podcasts: https://ark-invest.com/research/podcast\n\nLearn more about ARK: https://ark-invest.com/\n\nDisclosure: http://bit.ly/1C5DBVL",
