# YouTube Video Downloader

A Node.js script to download YouTube videos by their video ID using the `ytdl-core` library.

## Features

- ✅ Download single videos or batch download from file
- ✅ Progress tracking during downloads
- ✅ Multiple quality options (video and audio-only)
- ✅ Automatic filename sanitization
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Download summary reporting
- ✅ Customizable output directory

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js installed, then install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install ytdl-core
```

## Usage

### Download a Single Video

```bash
node download-video.js <video-id>
```

Example:
```bash
node download-video.js dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

### Download Multiple Videos from File

First, create a text file with video IDs (one per line):

```bash
node download-video.js --file
```

This will read from `videos.txt` by default. You can specify a different file:

```bash
node download-video.js --file my-videos.txt
```

### Show Help

```bash
node download-video.js --help
```

## Configuration

You can modify these settings at the top of `download-video.js`:

- **OUTPUT_DIR**: Directory where videos are saved (default: `./downloads`)
- **QUALITY**: Video quality preference (default: `'highest'`)

### Quality Options

- `'highest'`: Best video quality (default)
- `'lowest'`: Lowest video quality
- `'highestaudio'`: Best audio only (saves as .mp3)
- `'lowestaudio'`: Lowest audio only (saves as .mp3)

## Integration with videos.js

This downloader works perfectly with the existing `videos.js` script:

1. First, get video IDs from a channel:
   ```bash
   node videos.js
   ```

2. Then download all the videos:
   ```bash
   node download-video.js --file
   ```

## File Structure

```
ai-maker/
├── videos.js              # Get video IDs from YouTube channel
├── download-video.js       # Download videos by ID
├── examples.js            # Usage examples
├── videos.txt             # Video IDs (generated by videos.js)
└── downloads/             # Downloaded videos (auto-created)
```

## Examples

See `examples.js` for detailed usage examples:

```bash
node examples.js
```

## Error Handling

The script handles various error conditions:

- Invalid video IDs
- Network connectivity issues
- Insufficient disk space
- API rate limiting
- Unavailable videos

Failed downloads are logged and summarized for batch operations.

## Output

Downloaded videos are saved with the format:
```
[Video Title] - [Channel Name].[extension]
```

The script automatically:
- Sanitizes filenames for filesystem compatibility
- Creates the output directory if it doesn't exist
- Reports file sizes after download
- Shows progress during download
